	<font color="#0000FF" size="4">Microsaccades are a kind of fixational eye 
	movement. They are small, jerk-like, involuntary eye movements, similar to 
	miniature versions of voluntary saccades. They typically occur during 
	prolonged visual fixation (of at least several seconds), not only in humans, 
	but also in other animals, especially those with foveal vision (primates, 
	cats, etc.). Microsaccade amplitudes vary from 2 to 120 arcminutes. <br>
	<br>
	The role of microsaccades in visual perception has been a highly debated 
	topic which is still largely unresolved. It has been proposed that 
	microsaccades correct displacements in eye position produced by drifts, 
	although non-corrective microsaccades also occur. Microsaccades were also 
	believed to prevent the retinal image from fading, but they do not occur 
	often enough for that purpose, considering that perfectly stabilized images 
	can disappear from perception in a few seconds or less. The current 
	consensus is that all fixational eye movements are important for the 
	maintenance of visibility. <br>
	<br>
	Experiments in neurophysiology from different laboratories showed that 
	fixational eye movements, particularly microsaccades, strongly modulate the 
	activity of neurons in the visual areas of the macaque brain. In the lateral 
	geniculate nucleus(LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1), microsaccades 
	can move a stationary stimulus in and out of a neuron's receptive field, 
	thereby producing transient neural responses. Microsaccades might account 
	for much of the response variability of neurons in visual area V1 of the 
	awake monkey. <br>
	<br>
	Current research in visual neuroscience and psychophysics is investigating 
	how microsaccades relate to fixation correction, control of binocular 
	fixation disparity and attentional shifts. </font>
