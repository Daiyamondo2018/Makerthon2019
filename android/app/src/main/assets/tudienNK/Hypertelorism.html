			<font color="#0000FF" size="4"><i><b>Description <br>
			</b></i>Hypertelorism, or wide-set eyes, is a physical finding that 
			may occur alone or as a result of, or in association with, a number 
			of congenital deformities. They include frontonasal dysplasia, 
			craniosynostosis (such as is seen with Aperts,Crouzons, and related 
			syndromes), abnormalities or developmental problems related to nasal 
			deformity; facial clefting; hydrocephalus; or Encephalocele. <br>
			<br>
			Hypertelorism is diagnosed-usually at birth-when the interorbital 
			distance is greater than normal, with &quot;normal&quot; defined as less than 
			20 mm at birth. With growth of the mid-face, this disproportion 
			usually becomes more pronounced. In adults, a distance greater than 
			25 to 30 mm is considered abnormal. <br>
			<br>
			<b><i>Expectations and Treatment <br>
			</i></b>Although it can be corrected at a later time, we prefer to 
			correct this deformity between the ages of three and five years 
			after there has been a certain amount of development of the 
			mid-facial and orbital bones. <br>
			<br>
			In young children, the usual procedure is an inverted U-avoiding the 
			tooth-bearing area. In older children, we may use either total 
			translocation of the four walls of the orbit or a bipartition 
			procedure, depending on the type and involvement of the deformity.
			<br>
			<br>
			The primary correction of hypertelorism involves surgical 
			reconstruction of the nasal deformity that is universally associated 
			with this deformity. In patients with Encephalocelee, there may be a 
			long-nose syndrome which needs to be corrected. In frontonasal 
			dysplasia and facial clefting, there is a short nose which needs 
			elongation with soft-tissue procedures including VY techniques and 
			forehead flaps. <br>
			<br>
			Due to expansion that tends to recur in the soft tissue and in the 
			medial canthal region as the patient grows and develops, these 
			procedures usually must be repeated-more than three times on 
			average-before definitive correction of this deformity is achieved.
			<br>
			<br>
			Results can be anywhere from good to excellent, depending upon the 
			artistry of the surgeon performing the reconstruction of the nose.
