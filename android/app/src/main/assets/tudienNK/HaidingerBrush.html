	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">In 1846, the Austrian physicist Haidinger reported the 
	subtle visual impression produced by polarized light on the eye. Brewster 
	and Stokes studied the phenomenon and commented on it, but it has remained 
	one of the most obscure visual observations. It was described by Minnaert in
	<i>Light and Colour in the Open Air</i>, pp. 254-257, and if you can 
	possibly read it there, you should, if only to become acquainted with a 
	wonderful book.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">When polarized light enters your eye, you briefly see a 
	small spot near the center of the visual field that looks to many observers 
	like a yellowish double-ended brush with blue clouds on either side. The 
	yellowish brush is perpendicular to the electric vector of the polarized 
	light. The figure is stronger as the light is more completely polarized. 
	Unfortunately, like all small disturbances of the visual field that the 
	brain knows is not really there, the spot soon disappears unless an effort 
	is made to regenerate it by averting the vision. The spot cannot be seen by 
	staring at it! All observers find that it requires much practice before the 
	brush can be reliably seen. Minnaert could do it well.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Sensitivity to polarization is an effect of refraction and 
	reflection, or to dichroic molecules that absorb differently depending on 
	the direction of polarization relative to a molecular axis. In the case of 
	Haidinger's brush, dichroism of some point in the yellow spot, or macula, of 
	the retina is blamed. I have not heard of any recent research on this topic 
	that would shed a brighter light on the source of Haidinger's brush.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Minnaert says that the brush is more easily seen in a 
	garden globe, because the contrasts are made more vivid. Others report that 
	it is more easily seen through a green or blue glass, but disappears in a 
	red or yellow glass. Different observers are reported to see the spot 
	differently, which is not surprising, since its source is in the eye. 
	Sometimes the yellow is continuous, and sometimes the blue. Some say the 
	continuous color is the one most perpendicular to the line joining the eyes. 
	In sky light, the yellow brush points in the direction of the sun. This 
	property has been used to locate the point on the horizon where the rising 
	sun will first appear, to give a better chance of observing the green flash.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Blue skylight is polarized because it is light scattered 
	from molecular fluctuations in the upper atmosphere, and the polarization is 
	strongest at 90° from the sun. Light from clouds, or from a hazy sky, is not 
	polarized, and neither is the violet glow at twilight. The rainbow is 
	polarized, but its light is not suitable for seeing Haidinger's brush. Light 
	reflected from a dielectric plane (glass, water, mirage) is polarized with 
	its electric vector parallel to the reflecting surface. At the polarizing 
	angle, the reflected light is highly polarized. For glass, this is a 
	glancing angle of 34°, for water, 37°. Polarized sunglasses absorb light 
	polarized horizontally to reduce glare. Therefore, one can practice looking 
	for Haidinger's brush in the light reflected from a plate of glass. When you 
	rotate the glass, the brush should rotate as well. A Nicol prism is 
	excellent for the purpose, but they are now very hard to find. A common 
	polaroid can be tried, but perhaps the color will interfere.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">If you want to see Haidinger's brush, here is a procedure 
	that might work. Find a linear polarizer that is as color-free as possible. 
	A Nicol prism is best, but almost unobtainable these days. A good-quality 
	dichroic filter will also work. It should look gray, not green, blue or 
	orange. Look at a piece of white paper under rather strong white light. 
	Close one eye and put the polarizer before the other. Now rotate the 
	polarizer back and forth, and look for a delicate small pattern in the 
	center of the field of vision that rotates with the polarizer. It will look 
	like an hourglass shape of yellow with blue spots on each side. With some 
	eyes, the colors may be reversed. Whatever they are, if it rotates with the 
	polarizer, it is Haidinger's Brush. Remember that concentrating on the 
	pattern makes it disappear.</font></p>
