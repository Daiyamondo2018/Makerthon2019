	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">+ In a centered optical 
	system they are a pair of conjugate points on the axis which have the 
	property that any incident ray which passes through the first nodal point 
	leaves the system as though from the second nodal point and parallel to the 
	incident ray. Thus the refracted ray is unchanged in direction, although 
	displaced. The distance between the two nodal points is equal to the 
	distance between the two principal points. When the refractive indices on 
	each side of the system are equal as in the case of a thick lens in air, the 
	principal and nodal points coincide. They are the called equivalent points. 
	In a single refracting surface, the nodal points coincide with the center of 
	curvature, while the principal points coincide with the vertex of the 
	surface.</font></p>
