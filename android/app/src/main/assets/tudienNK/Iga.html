		Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is an antibody and, in its secretory form, is the 
		main immunoglobulin found in mucous <i>secretions, including tears, 
		saliva, colostrum, intestinal juice, vaginal fluid</i> and <i>secretions 
		from the prostate</i> and <i>respiratory epithelium</i>. It is also 
		found in small amounts in blood. Because it is resistant to degradation 
		by enzymes, secretory IgA can survive in harsh environments such as the 
		digestive and respiratory tracts, to provide protection against microbes 
		that multiply in body secretions.</font></p></li>

		Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is an antibody isotype that makes up about 1% of 
		proteins in the plasma membranes of immature B-lymphocytes where it is 
		usually coexpressed with another cell surface antibody called IgM. IgD 
		is also produced in a secreted form that is found in very small amounts 
		in blood serum. Secreted IgD is produced as a

		Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a class of antibody (or immunoglobulin 
		&quot;isotype&quot;) that has only been found in mammals. It plays an important 
		role in allergy, and is especially associated with type 1 
		hypersensitivity.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IgE#_note-0"> </a>
		IgE has also been implicated in immune system responses to some 
		parasitic worms like Schistosoma mansoni and Trichinella spiralis, and 
		may be important during immune defense against certain protozoan 
		parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum</font></p></li>

		Immunoglobulin G(IgG) is a monomeric immunoglobulin, built of two heavy 
		chains &#947; and two light chains. Each molecule has two antigen binding 
		sites. This is the most abundant immunoglobulin and is approximately 
		equally distributed in blood and in tissue liquids, constituting 75% of 
		serum immunoglobulins in humans. In birds, IgG is often called IgY, and 
		is found in serum and yolk.</font></p>
