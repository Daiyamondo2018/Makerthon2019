	</font><font size="4" color="#0000FF"><br>
	<b>1. SYMPTOMS</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Acute: Pain, red eye, photophobia, 
	consensual photophobia (pain in the affected eye when a light is shone in 
	the fellow eye).<br>
	<br>
	Chronic: Decreased vision. May have periods of exacerbations and remissions, 
	with few or none of the acute symptoms [especially juvenile rheumatoid 
	arthritis (JRA)].<br>
	SIGNS<br>
	<br>
	Critical. Cells and flare in the anterior chamber, ciliary flush, keratic 
	precipitates (KP):<br>
	<br>
	Fine (“stellate”; typically covers entire corneal endothelium): herpetic, 
	Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHIC), cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, 
	others.<br>
	<br>
	Large, greasy (“mutton-fat”; mostly on inferior cornea): sarcoidosis, 
	syphilis, tuberculosis, lens induced, Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) syndrome, 
	herpetic, others.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Other. Low intraocular pressure (IOP; more 
	commonly seen). Elevated IOP (especially herpetic, lens induced, FHIC, 
	Posner–Schlossman syndrome), fibrin [human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 or 
	infectious endophthalmitis], hypopyon (HLA-B27, Behçet disease, infectious 
	endophthalmitis, rifabutin, tumor), iris nodules (sarcoidosis, syphilis, 
	tuberculosis), iris atrophy (herpetic), iris heterochromia (FHIC), iris 
	synechiae (especially HLA-B27, sarcoidosis), band keratopathy (especially 
	JRA in younger patients, any chronic uveitis in older), uveitis in a “quiet 
	eye” (consider JRA, FHIC, masquerade syndromes), cystoid macular edema 
	(CME).</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"><br>
	<b>2. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Posterior uveitis with spillover into the 
	anterior chamber (Chief complaint will be floaters and decreased vision, 
	positive findings on fundus examination).<br>
	<br>
	Traumatic iritis<br>
	<br>
	Posner–Schlossman syndrome (Recurrent episodes of very high IOP and minimal 
	inflammation. Also open angle on gonioscopy, corneal edema, fine KP, and 
	fixed, mid-dilated pupil. See 9.13, Glaucomatocyclitic Crisis.).<br>
	<br>
	Drug-induced uveitis [e.g., rifabutin, cidofovir, sulfonamides, pamidronate 
	(inhibits bone resorption)].<br>
	<br>
	Sclerouveitis (Uveitis secondary to scleritis; typically present with 
	profound pain.).<br>
	<br>
	Tight contact lens (Red eye, corneal edema, epithelial defects, iritis ± 
	hypopyon, no stromal infiltrates.).<br>
	P.291<br>
	Infectious keratouveitis (History of corneal trauma or contact lens, corneal 
	infiltrate is present.).<br>
	<br>
	Infectious endophthalmitis (History of recent surgery, pain, hypopyon, 
	fibrin, vitritis, decreased vision, history of trauma, may have endogenous 
	source with fever, elevated white count.).<br>
	<br>
	Schwartz syndrome (Glaucoma and anterior chamber reaction caused by a 
	chronic low-lying retinal detachment, including retinal detachment with 
	dialysis.).<br>
	<br>
	Tumor (Retinoblastoma in children, intraocular lymphoma in elderly, 
	metastatic disease in all ages, others.).</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"><br>
	<b>3. ETIOLOGY</b><br>
	Acute</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Idiopathic.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">HLA-B27–associated uveitis. (Especially 
	young men with low back pain.).<br>
	*Note: Bilateral recurrent alternating anterior uveitis is very 
	characteristic of HLA-B27 uveitis.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Lens-induced uveitis (Often after 
	incomplete extracapsular cataract extraction or trauma damaging the lens 
	capsule; also may be secondary to a hypermature cataract or infection with 
	Propionibacterium acnes.).</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Postoperative iritis (An anterior chamber 
	reaction is expected after intraocular surgery. Severe reactions with 
	excessive pain, however, must make the examiner consider endophthalmitis. ).<br>
	<br>
	Uveitis–glaucoma–hyphema (UGH) syndrome (Usually secondary to irritation 
	from an intraocular lens (especially a closed-loop anterior chamber lens).<br>
	<br>
	Behçet disease (Young adults, acute hypopyon, iritis, aphthous mouth ulcers, 
	genital ulcerations, erythema nodosum, often retinal vasculitis and 
	hemorrhages, may have recurrent episodes.).<br>
	<br>
	Lyme disease (Often a history of a tick bite. May have a skin rash or 
	arthritis. ).<br>
	<br>
	Anterior segment ischemia (Caused by carotid insufficiency or tight scleral 
	buckle; flare out of proportion to the cellular reaction, pain.).<br>
	<br>
	Mumps, influenza, adenovirus, measles, chlamydia (Rare causes of transient 
	anterior uveitis.).<br>
	<br>
	Other rare causes of anterior uveitis (Leptospirosis, Kawasaki disease, 
	rickettsial disease.).</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Chronic<br>
	JRA [Usually young girls, eye may be white and without pain but flare may be 
	present, often bilateral, iritis can occur before the arthritis, 
	pauciarticular arthritis (fewer than five joints involved), positive 
	anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), negative rheumatoid factor, increased 
	erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), glaucoma, cataracts, band 
	keratopathy.].<br>
	<br>
	Chronic iridocyclitis of children (Usually young girls, similar to JRA 
	except no arthritis.).<br>
	<br>
	FHIC (Usually unilateral, few symptoms, diffuse iris stromal atrophy often 
	causing a lighter-colored iris, iris transillumination defects, blunting of 
	the iris architecture, fine KP over the entire corneal endothelium, mild 
	anterior chamber reaction, few if any posterior synechiae. Vitreous 
	opacities, glaucoma, and cataracts are common.).<br>
	Chronic, Usually with Granulomatous Signs (Mutton-Fat Keratic Precipitates, 
	Iris Nodules)<br>
	<br>
	Sarcoidosis [Usually African heritage, usually bilateral; may have dense 
	posterior synechiae, conjunctival nodules, or signs of posterior uveitis 
	(see 12.3, Posterior Uveitis). Mild to moderate anergy, abnormalities on 
	chest radiography, positive gallium scan, and increased serum 
	angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are common.<br>
	<br>
	Herpes simplex/herpes zoster/varicella (Look for corneal scars, history of 
	past unilateral recurrent red eye, occasionally history of skin vesicles, 
	associated with increased IOP, followed by iris atrophy).<br>
	<br>
	Syphilis [May have a maculopapular rash (often on the palms and soles), iris 
	roseola (vascular papules on the iris), and interstitial keratitis with 
	ghost vessels in late stages. Usually seen with uveitis in acquired syphilis 
	versus interstitial keratitis in congenital syphilis. A positive Venereal 
	Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and positive 
	fluorescent treponemal antibody, absorbed (FTA-ABS) are usually present. See 
	13.5, Acquired Syphilis.].<br>
	<br>
	Tuberculosis [Positive protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD), typical chest 
	radiograph, occasionally phlyctenular keratitis, sometimes signs of 
	posterior uveitis].<br>
	<br>
	Others [Rare (e.g., leprosy, brucellosis).].</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="4" color="#0000FF">4. WORKUP</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">1.Obtain a history and review of systems 
	(Table 12.1 and Table 12.2).<br>
	<br>
	2.Complete ocular examination, including an IOP check and a dilated fundus 
	examination. The vitreous should be evaluated for cells (see Appendix 8).<br>
	<br>
	3.A laboratory workup may be unnecessary in certain situations:<br>
	First-time occurrence of a mild, unilateral, nongranulomatous uveitis with a 
	history and examination that are not suggestive of systemic disease.<br>
	Uveitis occurring in the setting of known systemic disease such as 
	sarcoidosis or the patient is taking medicines known to cause uveitis (e.g., 
	rifabutin).<br>
	Clinical findings are classic for a particular diagnosis (e.g., herpetic 
	keratouveitis, FHIC, toxoplasmosis).</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">4.If the uveitis is bilateral, 
	granulomatous, or recurrent, and the history and examination are 
	unremarkable, then a nonspecific initial workup is conducted:<br>
	RPR or VDRL.<br>
	FTA-ABS or microhemagglutination–Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP).<br>
	PPD and anergy panel.<br>
	Chest radiograph to rule out sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.<br>
	<br>
	5.If a specific diagnosis is suspected, perform the following workup (Table 
	12.3).<br>
	<br>
	<b>5. TREATMENT</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">1.Cycloplegic (scopolamine, 0.25% b.i.d., 
	for mild to moderate inflammation; atropine, 1%, b.i.d. to q.i.d., for 
	severe inflammation. Use atropine with caution in patients at risk for 
	urinary retention.).<br>
	<br>
	2.Topical steroid (prednisolone acetate, 1%, one drop q1–6h, depending on 
	the severity). Most cases of moderate to severe acute uveitis require q1–2h 
	dosing initially.<br>
	If the anterior uveitis is severe and is not responding well to frequent 
	topical steroids, then consider periocular repository steroids (e.g., 
	triamcinolone 20 to 40 mg subtenon injection). Before injecting depot 
	steroids periocularly, it is wise to use topical steroids at full strength 
	for several weeks to make certain that the patient does not experience a 
	significant IOP increase from steroids. See Appendix 7, which describes the 
	technique of a subtenon injection.<br>
	<br>
	3.If there is no improvement on maximal topical and repository steroids, or 
	if the uveitis is bilateral and severe, consider systemic steroids, or 
	referral to a rheumatologist for immunosuppressive therapy. Consider 
	referral to a uveitis specialist.<br>
	<br>
	4.Treat secondary glaucoma with aqueous suppressants (not with pilocarpine 
	or prostaglandins). Glaucoma may result from:<br>
	A severe inflammatory reaction with cellular blockage of the trabecular 
	meshwork.<br>
	Synechiae formation giving rise to secondary angle closure. See 9.10, Acute 
	Angle-Closure Glaucoma.<br>
	Neovascularization of the iris, producing blockage of the trabecular 
	meshwork or closure of the angle. <br>
	A response to steroids.<br>
	<br>
	5.If an exact etiology for the anterior uveitis is determined, then the 
	specific management outlined as follows should be added to these treatments.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Ankylosing spondylitis: Often requires 
	systemic antiinflammatory agents [e.g., aspirin, nonsteroidal 
	antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), naproxen (e.g., Naprosyn), or 
	indomethacin]. Consider cardiology consult (there is a high incidence of 
	heart block and aortic insufficiency), rheumatology consult, and physical 
	therapy consult.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Inflammatory bowel disease: Often benefits 
	from systemic steroids or sulfadiazine or both and supplemental vitamin A. 
	Needs a medical or gastrointestinal consult.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Reiter syndrome: If urethritis is present, 
	then the patient and sexual partners are treated for chlamydia (e.g., 
	tetracycline, 250 to 500 mg, q.i.d., doxycycline, 100 mg, b.i.d., or 
	erythromycin, 250 to 500 mg, q.i.d., for 3 to 6 weeks; can also use 
	clarithromycin, azithromycin). Obtain medical, rheumatology, or physical 
	therapy consult or a combination of these.<br>
	<br>
	Psoriatic arthritis: Consider a rheumatology or dermatology consult.<br>
	<br>
	Glaucomatocyclitic crisis.<br>
	<br>
	Lens-induced uveitis: Usually requires removal of lens material. <br>
	<br>
	Herpes uveitis: Herpes simplex requires prophylactic antivirals when 
	atypical or taking steroids. May benefit from systemic antiviral medications 
	(e.g., acyclovir).&nbsp; Herpes Simplex Virus; or 4.15, Herpes Zoster Virus.<br>
	<br>
	UGH syndrome.<br>
	<br>
	Behçet disease: Often needs systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents 
	(responds well to chlorambucil); consider a medical or rheumatology consult. 
	Consider referral to a uveitis specialist for long-term management.<br>
	<br>
	Lyme disease.<br>
	<br>
	JRA: The steroid dosage is adjusted according to the degree of cells, not 
	flare, present in the anterior chamber; prolonged cycloplegic therapy may be 
	required. A rheumatology or pediatric consult is obtained for possible 
	systemic steroid therapy or methotrexate.<br>
	*Note: JRA has a high complication rate with cataract surgery.<br>
	<br>
	Chronic iridocyclitis of children: Same as JRA.<br>
	<br>
	FHIC: Usually does not respond to or require steroids (a trial of steroids 
	may be attempted, but they should be tapered quickly if there is no 
	response); cycloplegics are rarely necessary.<br>
	*Note: Patients with FHIC usually do well with cataract surgery.<br>
	<br>
	Sarcoidosis: Often needs periocular and systemic steroids; a medicine or 
	pulmonary consult is advisable for systemic evaluation</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Syphilis<br>
	<br>
	Tuberculosis: Avoid systemic steroids. Refer the patient to an internist for 
	consideration of systemic antituberculous treatment.</font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"><br>
	<b>6. FOLLOW-UP</b></font></p>
	<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">1.Every 1 to 7 days in the acute phase, 
	depending on the severity; every 1 to 6 months when stable.<br>
	<br>
	2.At each visit, the anterior chamber reaction and IOP should be evaluated.<br>
	<br>
	3.A vitreous and fundus examination should be performed for all flareups, 
	when vision is affected, or every 3 to 6 months.<br>
	<br>
	4.If the anterior chamber reaction is improving, then the steroid drops can 
	be slowly tapered [usually one drop per day every 3 to 7 days (e.g., q.i.d. 
	for 1 week, then t.i.d. for 1 week, then b.i.d. for 1 week)]. Steroids are 
	usually discontinued once all cells have disappeared from the anterior 
	chamber (flare is often still present). Rarely, long-term low-dose steroids 
	every day or every other day are required to keep the inflammation from 
	recurring. Punctal occlusion techniques may increase potency of drug and 
	decrease systemic absorption. The cycloplegic agents also can be tapered as 
	the anterior chamber reaction improves. Cycloplegics should be used at least 
	every evening until the anterior chamber is free of cells.<br>
	*Note: As with most ocular and systemic diseases requiring steroid therapy, 
	the steroid (be it topical or systemic) should never be discontinued 
	abruptly. Sudden discontinuation of steroids can lead to severe rebound 
	inflammation.<br>
