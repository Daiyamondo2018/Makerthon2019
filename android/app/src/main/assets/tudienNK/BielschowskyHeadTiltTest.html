	<p align="justify"><font size="4" color="#0000FF">+ A test to determine 
	which of the inferior or superior extraocular muscles and of which eye is 
	paretic. The test is based on the following fact: if the head is tilted to 
	the right, the right intorters of the right eye (superior oblique and 
	superior rectus muscle) contract as well as the extorters of the left eye 
	(inferior oblique and inferior rectus muscles). If the head is tilted to the 
	left, the inferior oblique and inferior rectus muscles of the right eye 
	contract to cause extorsion while the superior oblique and superior rectus 
	of the left eye contract to cause intorsion. Thus, tilting the head towards 
	one side will indicate the palsied muscle. For example, in the right 
	superior rectus muscle palsy when the head is tilted to the left there will 
	be no change in there vertical deviation, since contraction of the right 
	superior rectus muscle is not involved. However, when the head is tilted to 
	the right there will be an increase in downward movement. This test is not 
	reliable in an adult with congenital ocular palsy.</font></p>
