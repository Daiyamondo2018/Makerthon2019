<td><font color="#0000EE">English neurophysiologist, born 27th November, 1857, London, died 4th
March, 1952, Eastbourne, Sussex.&nbsp;

</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE">Sir Charles Scott Sherrington's research, spanning more than 50 years,
laid the foundations for modern neurophysiology. He maintained that the
most important function of the nervous system in higher animals is the
coordination of the various parts of the organism. Although best known
for his long series of studies on spinal reflexes, he made equally great
strides in the physiology of perception, reaction, and behaviour. He was
the first to adequately study the synapse and originated the term. He also
introduced the term exterioceptor, proprioceptor and viscerocepter. In
1932 he shared the Nobel Prise in Physiology or Medicine with Edgar Douglas
Adrian.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Sherrington was the son of Anne Brookes and James Norton Sherrington,
of Caister, Great Yarmouth, a country physician who died when he was quite
young. His mother married Caleb Rose, Jr., of Ipswich, a physician of wide
cultural interests and a noted archaeologist. The Rose home, a gathering
place for artists and scholars, helped to shape Sherrington's broad interest
in science, philosophy, history, and poetry. One of his schoolmasters,
Thomas Ashe, was a poet of considerable distinction.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">After attending the Ipswich Grammar School from 1870 to 1875, Sherrington,
encouraged by his stepfather, began medical training at St. Thomas&#8217;s Hospital
in London. He passed the primary examination of the Royal College of Surgeons
in 1878, and a year later the primary examination for the Fellowship of
that College.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1879 he went to Cambridge as a noncollegiate student studying physiology
under the &#8220;father of British physiology&#8221;, Sir Michael Foster (1836-1907),
and in 1880 entered Gonville and Caius College there. During the years
1881-1885 he worked chiefly under two of Forster's pupils who were already
becoming world famous &#8211; John Newport Langley (1852-1925) and Walter Gaskell
(1847-1914). Langley and Gaskell imparted to him their dominant interest
in how anatomical structure reflects, or is expressed in, physiological
function.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1881 he attended a medical congress in London at which Sir Michael
Foster discussed the work of Sir Charles Bell and others on the experimental
study of the functions of nerves that was then being done in England and
elsewhere in Europe. At this congress controversy arose about the effects
of excisions of parts of the cortex of the brains of dogs and monkeys done
by David Ferrier (1843-1928) and Friedrich Leopold Goltz (1834-1902) of
Strasbourg. Subsequently, Sherrington worked on this problem in Cambridge
with Langley, and with him published, in 1884, a paper on it. In this manner
Sherrington was introduced to the neurological work to which he afterwards
devoted his life.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1883 Sherrington became Demonstrator of Anatomy at Cambridge under
Professor Sir George Humphrey, and during the winter session of 1883-1884
at St. Thomas's Hospital he demonstrated histology.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">From 1884 to 1887 Sherrington completed his medical courses. After graduation
he worked with Langley, studying the anatomical changes in the cord and
brain stem of decorticate dogs which had first been exhibited by Friedrich
Goltz at the International Congress in 1881. This led to the first of many
visits to Goltz' laboratory in Strassburg.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Between 1884 and 1887 he turned his attention to bacteriology. In 1885
Sherrington went, as a member of a Committee of the Association for Research
in Medicine, to Spain to study an outbreak of cholera, and in 1886 he visited
the Venice district also to investigate the same disease. In Spain he met
Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934) and later persuaded him to lecture
in England. He also went to Berlin to have the cholera material examined
under the supervision of Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), who later sent Sherrington
to Robert Koch (1843-1910) for a six weeks' course in technique. Sherrington
stayed with Koch to do research in bacteriology for a year. Thus he gained
a superb grounding in physiology, morphology, histology, and pathology.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He obtained his M.R.C.S. in 1884 and in 1885 a First Class in the Natural
Sciences Tripos at Cambridge with distinction. During this year he published
a paper of his own on the subject of Goltz's dogs. In 1885 he also took
his M.B. degree at Cambridge and in 1886 became a Licentiate of the Royal
College of Physicians.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1887 Sherrington was appointed lecturer in physiology at St. Thomas&#8217;s
medical school in London, where he continued to investigate the spinal
tract. From 1891 to 1905 he served as physician-superintendent of the Brown
Institution, a centre for human and animal physiological and pathological
research, succeeding Sir Victor Alexander Haden Horsley (1857-1916). Here
he was able to observe animals with chronic spinal lesions.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1895 Sherrington was appointed Holt Professor of physiology in Liverpool,
where he did much of his best work. From 1913 until his retirement in 1935
he held Waynflete chair of physiology at Oxford, succeeding Francis Gotch
(1853-1913).
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Research</b>
<br>Working on cats, dogs, monkeys and apes that had been bereaved of their
cerebral hemispheres, he found that reflexes must be considered integrated
activities of the total organism, not just the result of the activities
of the so-called reflex-arcs, a concept then generally accepted. The proofs
supporting "total integration" were his demonstration during the years
1895 to 1898 of reciprocal innervation of muscles, also known as Sherrington's
law: when one set os muscles is stimulated, muscles working against the
activity of the first will be inhibited.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He developed the theory of transmission at the synapse being in one
direction, decerebrate rigidity was then a background in which the presence
of reciprocal inhibition was lost and these findings and theories resulted
in his publication in 1906 a monograph entitled Integrative action of the
nervous system which remains a classic.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In this classic of modern neurology, he summed up his years of experiments
and observations on the nervous system and the reflexes and developed a
theory that has had a far-reaching and profound influence on modern neurophysiology
and clinical neurology. Briefly, his theory was that the nervous system
acts as the coordinator of various parts of the body and that the reflexes
are the simplest expressions of the interactive action of the nervous system,
enabling the entire body to function toward one definite end at a time.
Shared the Nobel prize with Adrian for their work on the nervous system.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He established the nature of postural reflexes and their dependence
on the anti-gravity stretch reflex and traced the afferent stimulus to
the proprioceptive end organs which he had already shown to be sensory
in nature.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Most of his work occurred after he had been appointed professor of physiology
at Liverpool on 1895.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>The man</b>
<br>Sherrington married Ether Wright of Suffolk, England, on August 27,
1891; their only child, Carr E. R. Sherrington, was born in 1897
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In physique Sherrington was a well-built, but not very tall man with
a strong constitution which enabled him to carry out prolonged researches.
During the First World War, as Chairman of the Industrial Fatigue Board,
he worked for a time in a shell factory at Birmingham, and the daily shift
of 13 hours, with a Sunday shift of 9 hours, did not, at the age of 57,
tire him. From his early years he was short-sighted, but he often worked
without spectacles.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Besides his scientific work Sherrington was a man of wide interests
and accomplishments: biographer, medical historian, poet, and book collector
&#8211; and sportsman. As a boy and a young man Sherrington was a notable athlete
both at Queen Elizabeth's School, Ipswich, where he went in 1871, and later
at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, for which College he rowed and
played rugby football; he was also a pioneer of winter sports at Grindelwald,
Switzerland.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Sherrington always had a love for classics and poetry and in 1925 published
a volume of collected verse, The Assaying of Brabantius and other Verse.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Following his retirement he published Man on his Nature, which centres
round the life and views of the 16th century French physician Jean Fernel
, and in 1946 The Endeavour of Jean Fernel.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He was elected President of the Royal Society of Physicians in 1920
and held this chair of honour for five years. Other honours included the
Knight Grand Cross of the British Empire (1922) and the Order of Merit
(1924). At his death he was an honorary fellow, member, or associate of
more than forty academies, and he had received honorary degrees from twenty-two
universities.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1932 Sir Charles Scott Sherrington shared the Nobel Prise in Physiology
or Medicine with Edgar Douglas Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian (1889-1977). The
received the prize "for their discoveries regarding the function of neurons."
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">From 1941 onwards he developed a painful arthritis which remained with
him until he died. Right until the end he maintained his mental alertness
and was an entertaining conversationalist.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><ul><font color="#0000EE">Suppose we choose the hour of deep sleep. Then only in some sparse
and out of the way places are nodes flashing and trains of light-points
running. Such places indicate local activity still in progress. At one
such place we can watch the behaviour of a group of lights perhaps a myriad
strong. They are pursuing a mystic and recurrent manoeuvre as if of some
incantational dance. They are superintending the beating of the heart and
the state of the arteries so that while we sleep the circulation of the
blood is what it should be. The great knotted headpiece of the whole sleeping
system lies for the most part dark, and quite especially so the roof-brain.
Occasionally at places in it lighted points flash or move but soon subside.
Such lighted points and moving trains of light are mainly far in the outskirts,
and wink slowly and travel slowly. At intervals even a gush of sparks wells
up and sends a train down the spinal cord, only to fail to arouse it. Where
however the stalk joins the headpiece, there goes forward in a limited
field a remarkable display. A dense constellation of some thousands of
nodal points burst out every few seconds into a short phase of rhythmical
flashing. At first a few lights, then more, increasing in rate and number
with a deliberate crescendo to a climax, then to decline and die away.
After due pause the efflorescence is repeated. With each such rhythmic
outburst goes a discharge of trains of travelling lights along the stalk
and out of it altogether into a number of nerve branches. What is this
doing? It manages the taking of our breath the while we sleep.

</p><p><font color="#0000EE">"It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance. Swiftly the
brain becomes an enchanted loom, where millions of flashing shuttles weave
a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding
one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns."&nbsp;
<br>The Integrative Action of the Nervous System&nbsp;

and of their desires and are oblivious to the causes which dispose them
to desire and to will.&nbsp;
<br>Man On His Nature, page 163
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Swiftly the head-mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing
shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though
never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of sub-patterns. Now as the waking
body rouses, subpatterns of this great harmony of activity stretch down
into the unlit tracks of the stalk-piece of the scheme. Strings of flashing
and travelling sparks engage the lengths of it. This means that the body
is up and rises to meet its waking day.&nbsp;
<br>Man On His Nature, page 178
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The mind is a something with such manifold variety, such fleeting changes,
such countless nuances, such wealth of combinations, such heights and depths
of mood, such sweeps of passion, such vistas of imagination, that the bald
submission of some electrical potentials recognizable in nerve-centres
as correlative to all these may seem to the special student of mind almost
derisory. It is, further, more than mere lack of corresponding complexity
which frustrates the comparison.&nbsp;
<br>Man On His Nature, page 228
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">If as you say thoughts are an outcome of the brain we as students using
the energy-concept know nothing of it; as followers of natural science
we know nothing of any relation between thoughts and the brain, except
as a gross correlation in time and space. In some ways this is embarrassing
for biology.&nbsp;
<br>Man On His Nature, page 229
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">We have to regard the relation of mind to brain as not merely unresolved
but still devoid of a basis for its very beginning.&nbsp;
<br>Man On His Nature
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The eye sends, as we saw, into the cell-and-fibre forest of the brain,
throughout the waking day continual rhythmic streams of tiny, individually
evanescent, electrical potentials. This throbbing streaming crowd of electrically
shifting points in the spongework of the brain bears no obvious semblance
in space-pattern, and even in temporal relation resembles but a little
remotely the tiny two-dimensional upside-down picture of the outside world
which the eyeball paints on the beginnings of its nerve-fibres to the brain.
But that little picture sets up an electrical storm .... A shower of little
electrical leaks conjures up for me, when I look at him approaching, my
friend's face, and how distant he is from me they tell me. Taking their
word for it, I go forward and my other senses confirm that he is there.&nbsp;
