<p><font color="#0000EE">Jan Evangelista Purkinje was born in Libochovice, Bohemia (Czech Republic)
on December 17, 1787. He graduated from the University of Prague in 1819
with a degree in medicine. After publishing his doctoral dissertation on
vision, he was appointed as Professor of Physiology at the University of
Prague, where he discovered the phenomenon known as the Pukinje effect
(as light intensity decreases, red objects are perceived to fade faster
than blue objects of the same brightness). He also re-published his doctoral
dissertation as the first volume of Beobachtungen und Versuche zur Physiologie
der Sinne (Observations and Experiments Investigating the Physiology of
Senses). The second volume, which followed in 1825, was subtitled Neue
Beitrage zur Kenntnis des Sehens in subjectiver Hinsicht (New Subjective
Reports about Vision). These two volumes contributed to the emergence of
experimental psychology. Purkinje created the world&#8217;s first department
of physiology at the University of Breslau, Prussia in 1839 and the first
official physiological laboratory, known as the Physiological Institute,
in 1842.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Purkinje&#8217;s experimental method used to explore the parameters of the
sensory experience helped lay the foundation for future laboratory work.
Purkinje observed the psychological consequences in visual experience after
stimulation, including application of pressure and electrical current to
the eyeball, alteration in point of light exposure relative to fovea, degree
of eye movement and variation in the intensity of light. He is best known
for his discovery, in 1837, of Purkinje cells, large nerve cells with many
branching extensions found in the cortex of the cerebral cortex. He is
also known for his 1839 discovery of Purkinje fibers, the fibrous tissue
that conducts the pacemaker stimulus along the inside walls of the ventricles
to all parts of the heart. Purkinje introduced the scientific terms plasma,
to describe the clear liquid remaining after blood has been cleared of
it&#8217;s various corpuscle components, and protoplasm, used to describe young
animal embryos.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Purkinje was the first to use the microtome (to slice thin tissue sections),
glacial acetic acid, potassium bichromate and Canada balsam in the preparation
of tissue samples for microscopic examination. Purkinje described the effects
of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpintine on humans in 1829. An early
user of the improved compound microscope, he discovered the sweat glands
of the skin in 1833, germinal vessicles in 1825, recognized fingerprints
as a means of identification in 1823 and noted the protein-digesting power
of pancreatic extracts in 1836.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Johannes Evangelista Purkinje was a pioneer to experimental physiology
whose investigations in the fields of histology, embryology and pharmacology
helped to create a modern understanding of the eye and vision, brain and
heart function, mammalian reproduction and the composition of cells. Purkinje
died at the age of 82 on July 28, 1869.&nbsp;
