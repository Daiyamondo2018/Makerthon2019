<p><font color="#0000EE"><b><a href="../ArgyllrobertsonPupils.html">Argyll Robertson's syndrome</a></b> = A frequent symptom of neurosyphilis,
especially tabes dorsalis, and other diseases of thecentral nervous system,
in which the pupil is small and responds slowly or not at all to light,
but reaction to accommodation and convergence is retained.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Douglas Moray Cooper Lamb Argyll Robertson</b>
<br>was one of the first surgeons to specialize entirely in the field of
ophthalmology and his name has been forever associated with the phenomenon
he described in the pupil found in tabes dorsalis.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE">In 1869 Argyll Robertson described the phenomenon in two articles. The
pupils of these patients were small; they did not react to light, but reacted
at accommodation and were only incompletely dilated by atropine. Miotic,
irregular pupils without reaction to light were known in singular cases
of tabes dorsalis and paralysie générale since the end of
the eighteenth century. The combination of miosis and pupils without reaction
to light while the power of contraction during accommodation was retained,
however, had never before been described.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The "Argyll-Robertson's pupil" soon attracted much attention and was
to take a prominent position in the sometimes hateful debate going on in
the latter part of the nineteenth century about a common aetiology of tabes
dorsalis, paralysie générale and other cerebral lues. Among
the more famous proponents of a luetic aetiology were Jean Alfred Fournier
(1832-1915) and Sir Jonathan Hutchinson (1828-1913).
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Not until the beginning of this century was lues generally accepted
as the definitive causes of the different manifestations from the nervous
system, following the discovery by Schaudinn and Hoffmann of the treponema
pallidium in 1905 and August Paul von Wassermann&#8217;s (1866-1925) serologic
test in 1906.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Douglas Moray Cooper Lamb Argyll Robertson was born in 1837 in Edinburgh,
where his father, John Argyll Robertson, was a general surgeon, with a
special interest in surgery of the eye. He received his early education
in Edinburgh, and then studied medicine at St. Andrews, from where he graduated
in 1857, the year of his father&#8217;s death. He returned to Edinburgh to work
as a house surgeon at the Royal Infirmary before departing for Berlin to
study under the leading ophthalmologist of the day, Albrecht von Graefe
(1828-1870). In this he was following on the work of his father who had
been a lecturer in surgery at Edinburgh in the extra-mural school and had
confined himself chiefly to ophthalmic surgery. During the 1850s, the invention
of the ophthalmoscope by Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-1894)
in 1851, and the new operations such as iridectomy introduced by von Graefe
in 1856 ensured that ophthalmology developed into a specialty of its own
right.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The first ophthalmic surgeon on the staff of the Royal Infirmary was
William Walker, who was elected in July 1855. But Argyll Robertson, who
had qualified in medicine at the age of 20, had gone almost straight into
this subject. He was a lecturer in diseases of the eye at the Edinburgh
Medical School as early as in 1862. In the March edition of Edinburgh Medical
Journal 1863, he published an article of great importance on the Calabar
bean. The Calabar bean (Physostigma venenosum) is the seed of a leguminouis
plant found in Calabar, in the eastern region of Nigeria. A solution of
the seed extract was used by the natives for judicial execution &#8211; if the
man vomited it back then he was considered innocent.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The first experimental use reported on the bean was by Sir Robert Christison
(1797-1882), one of Argyll Robertson's teachers, who did not describe any
effects of the eye but recommended its use for the humane execution of
criminals. Argyll Robertson instilled an extract into his own eye and made
the deduction that physostigmine contracts the pupil. He predicted it would
become &#8220;an agent that will soon rank as one of the most valuable in the
ophthalmic pharmacopoeia&#8221;. The same year, his former teacher von Graefe
utilized its miotic effect to facilitate iridectomy.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">1862 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.
In 1867 he was appointed assistant ophthalmic surgeon to the Royal Infirmary
of Edinburgh, and the following year described the phenomenon that bears
his name. In 1870 he became full ophthalmic surgeon to the Royal Infirmary.
From 1895 he was extraordinary, and from 1897 consultative ophthalmologist.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1894 the Calabar connection recurred in that a patient who had lived
in Old Calabar for the previous eight years consulted him. She complained
of a tickling, irritating sensation under the skin of the eyelids, which
she had noticed, was worse in warm surroundings. He observed a worm &#8220;moving
in a tortuous wriggling manner under the conjunctiva, the surface of which
became slightly elevated as it moved along&#8221;. He anaesthetized the conjunctiva,
incised it and removed the worm intact. It was found to be a filarial loa,
which he presumed had got there through bathing in contaminated water.
We know now that the vectors are flies and that the adult worms migrate
through the subcutaneous tissue causing fugitive &#8220;Calabar swellings&#8221; and
sometimes beneath the conjunctiva &#8211; hence the popular name &#8220;eye worm&#8221;.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Argyll Robertson in 1883 began teaching ophthalmology at the University
of Edinburgh, remaining in this office until 1897, when he retired from
active hospital service. From 1893 to 1895 he was chairman of the ophthalmologic
society of England, 1886 chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh,
honorary eye physician to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. In 1904,
for health reasons, he moved to the Island of Jersey, and in 1908 made
a journey to India. He caught a cold in Gondal near Bombay, and died there.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Argyll Robertson left no large number of medical publications; according
to his obituary he "preferred the tongue to the pen as a medium". In 1863
he described the clinical effects on the eye from physostigmin - The calabar
beam as a new ophthalmic agent, a major contribution to the treatment of
glaucoma. He was also the first to describe a trepanning method of operation
for certain cases of glaucoma.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Argyll Robertson was a man of broad medical interests, always emphasizing
the role of ophthalmology in a wider medical context. He published observations
on the albuminuretic retinopathy and lectured on the topic of "The therapeutical
contributions of ophthalmology to general medicine" at his inauguration
as president of the Ophthalmological Society.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Besides his professional standing Argyll Robertson seems to have impressed
his contemporaries by his social appearance and party talents. This side
of his personality was thus summarized in a biographical note: "His handsome
features and his tall, athletic frame made him the cynosure of all female
eyes in his youth and in his later years, clad in a grey frock-coat and
top hat, his dignified manner combined with his genial old-world courtesy
made him conspicuous in any assembly and a magnificent ambassador of Scotland,
firmly establishing that country in the social world of ophthalmology.
He attributed his good health to golf and considered it the finest recreation
in the world. Even though it was recreation, however, he brought to it
the same skill he had as a surgical operator, winning the gold medal of
the Royal and Ancient Club of St. Andrews five times.
