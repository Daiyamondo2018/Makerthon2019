<td><font color="#0000EE">Austrian ophthalmologist, born 14th June, 1851, Vienna; died November
21, 1930, Vienna.
</font>
<p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Fuchs' corneal dystrophy</b> = Familial degenerative condition of
the eye seen more commonly in women, with clouding of the cornea and often
complicated by glaucoma.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis</b> = An idiopathic disorder of the
eye, with heterochromia, uveitis of the lighter coloured eye, iridocyclitis,
keratitic precipitates and often catarct.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Fuchs' spot</b> = A small black spot on the fundus in high myopia,
occurring after macular haemorrhage

</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE">Ernst Fuchs studied medicine in Vienna where he was a pupil of Ernst
von Brücke (1819-1892), Christian Albert Theodor Billroth (1829-1894),
and Carl Ferdinand von Arlt (1812-1887). Already while a student he held
a position as assistant at the physiological institute in Innsbruck.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Having obtained his doctorate in 1874, he began as an apprentice of
surgery under Billroth, and from 1876 to 1880 was assistant to the oculist
Arlt who was then professor of ophthalmology in Vienna, a man for whom
throughout his life Fuchs had the greatest admiration and respect. From
1880 to 1885 Fuchs was professor of ophthalmology in Lüttich, and
in 1885 succeeded Eduard Jaeger Ritter von Jaxtthal (1818-1884) in the
chair at Vienna.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Fuchs&#8217; earliest work consisted of an examination of the pathology of
conditions of the eye and this approach enabled him to publish in 1881
an analysis of sarcoma of the uveal tract based on 259 patients. In the
same year he was appointed to the chair of ophthalmology in the University
of Liege.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1882 Fuchs emphasised the difference between the acquired atrophic
crescents and congenital crescents due to a defect in the development of
the choroid which usually occurs at the lower margin of the optic disc
and which is small and oval horizontally - a condition now often referred
to as Fuchs coloboma. In 1885 he returned to Vienna, publishing an important
paper on the anatomy of the iris, and in 1889 the first edition of his
textbook of ophthalmology, Lehrbuch der Augenheilkunde.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">This book was taken from his lectures in an endeavour to ensure that
his students listened to his lectures rather than distract themselves by
taking notes. It was a classic in its time and published in all European
languages as well as Japanese and Chinese. Fuchs employed the then new
technique of using large print for material suitable for students and small
prints for that which he felt was important for people who were continuing
to study ophthalmology as a postgraduate exercise.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Fuchs succeeded Eduard Jaeger Ritter von Jaxtthal (1818-1884) as ordinarius
of ophthalmology in Vienna in 1885, and held this position until 1915.
He died in Vienna in 1930.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Georg Joseph Beer (1763-1821) was the first professor of opthalmology
in Vienna, appointed to an extraordinary chair in 1812, and he was succeeded
by Fuchs&#8217; teacher, Arlt, who rapidly made Vienna the centre of the world
for this speciality. Fuchs added to this renown and an idea of the number
of patients he saw may be gauged from an article in 1897 on «retinitis
circinata» where he states that of 70.000 patients who had been seen
during the 7,5 years in his clinic, he had only seen 11 patients with this
rare condition.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The Shah of Persia, Nasr-ed-Din, sent his favourite wife, who had been
diagnosed as having a cataract, together with several other women with
cataracts, to Fuchs for his treatment. When Fuchs examined her he found
that she had glaucoma and there was nothing he could do, but he was able
to remove the cataracts from the women who accompanied her. The Shah could
never comprehend how Fuchs could restore the sight of servants and could
do nothing for his favourite concubine.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Fuchs was a great traveller and also enjoyed walking on his vacations
in out-of-the-way places. Besides his clinical descriptions of diseases
of the eye and his accurate recording of the various afflictions of the
retina, as well as his interest in histopathology, he also was an innovator
in surgery. Largely through his efforts the age-old custom of a patient
after a cataract operation being kept in bed with both eyes covered in
a dark room for a week before the dressings were changed, was abandoned.
He introduced early ophthalmoscopic examinations after these operations
which enabled him to discover that choroidal detachment was far more common
than had previously been imagined.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At the outbreak of World War I Fuchs was a very wealthy man as one might
imagine from the size of his practice, and he lived accordingly. But after
the war, due to the inflation that ensued, he became quite hard up, and
in view of his could do little about it, although he was helped greatly
by his friends and admirers, who enabled him to undertake a lecture tour
to the United States; subsequently he visited Spain, Egypt and Asia Minor.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">A tall man with a slight stoop, Fuchs apparently embodied all of Osler&#8217;s
ideals of equinamitas, maintaining a calm and unruffled exterior and never
being angry or impatient. He spoke excellent English and maintained his
investigatory curiosity right to the very end, when he died with angina
pectoris.
