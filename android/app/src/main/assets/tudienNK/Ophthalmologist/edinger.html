<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>The founder of comparative neuro-anatomy</b>
<br>Ludwig Edinger was born in Worms, on the Rhine, the eldest son of a
self-made, well-to-do textile manufacturer. When he was fourteen, his mother
arranged that he was given a microscope. He was fascinated by it, &#8220;I shall
never forget my ecstasy . . . Corkstoppers, flies, house-dust . . . nothing
was safe. He early learned the technique of embedding and mounting his
own preparations.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Edinger was a poor student at school, however, and on finishing the
Gymnasium he flung his books over his garden wall, only to retrieve Homer,
Horace and Sophocles.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At the University of Heidelberg he was bored by famous names like Friedrich
Arnold in anatomy, whose theories he despised as pathetic and speculative.
Bunsen, the old physicist, he decided not to listen to at all. When examined
by Theodor Schwann, he forgot what he might have known of Schwann&#8217;s cell
theory. The two teachers he let himself be influenced by, were Carl Gegenbauer
(1826-1903), and the clinical neurologist Ernst Victor von Leyden (1832-1910),
whose book on comparative anatomy he took along on his vacation. In 1876
he was conferred doctor of medicine at the University of Strassburg, being
approbiert as a physician in 1877.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Already as a student Edinger had shown particular interest in the diseases
of the nervous system. In 1877, one year after his dissertation, he became
assistant to Adolf Kussmaul (1822-1902). Working at Strassburg, in the
tower over the hospital gate, Edinger was particularly stimulated by Wilhelm
Waldeyer-Hartz (1834-1921). Under his guidance, Edinger in 1877 published
his first neurological paper, <i>Die Endigung der Hautnerven bei Pterotrachea</i>.
At this time Edinger also saw much of Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen
(1833-1910), got to know the work of Benedikt Stilling (1810-1879), and
became a friend of Friedrich Leopold Goltz 1834-1902).
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1879 Edinger commenced academic work in Giessen under Franz Riegel
(1843-1904). At this time, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen was the physicist
there, still unknown.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1881, only twenty-six years old, Edinger was awarded his habilitation.
He then spent a year travelling, visiting Berlin and Paris. Edinger then
taught at the University of Giessen until 1883, when he came to Frankfurt
am Main to practise neurology. Here, his small practice left him ample
time for scientific work, which he greatly preferred. The microtome he
had purchased was set up in his kitchen and his mother&#8217;s jelly glasses
put to use for staining sections.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Besides his practical and scientific work, Edinger was a busy teacher.
In the years from 1883 to 1885 he gave numerous, well attended lectures
on the structure of the nervous system. Working on the human fetuses in
the winter of 1883/1884 Edinger identified the spinal course of a fiber
group, a forerunner of his later discovery, in 1889, of a &#8220;tractus spino-bulbo-thalamicus,&#8221;
a pathway previously partly traced, in 1885, by Vladimir Mikhailovitsj
Bekhterev (1857-1927). In 1885 appeared his famous text on the structure
of the nervous system, an outgrowth of lectures given before the Frankfurt
medical society.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Edinger&#8217;s attitude toward comparative neurology was summed up as follows:
&#8220;Once the configuration of a given structure has been studied in detail
in some forms, one can generally easily discover it in other forms even
when it is more or less obscured by new additions.&#8221;&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1885 Edinger became closely associated with Carl Weigert (1845-1904)
who had just perfected his stain for the myelin sheath and built up and
financed a neurological institute. For the next 20 years hardly a day would
pass withous some contact between them, often at Edinger&#8217;s home, with discussions
lasting well after midnight.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1903 he had his own reseach department at the Senckenbergisches Pathologisches
Institut in Frankfurt. This became an independent neurological station,
and in 1907 was moved to a new building with the most modern facilities.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Edinger became titular professor as early as in 1904. In 1914 he was
made ordinarius in neurology at the recently founded Goethe University
in Frankfurt and his institute was founded by the "Ludwig Edinger Stiftung".
However, he did not live to see the clinical department attached to it.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Profound scientist, brilliant teacher, and able organizer, Edinger was
also noted as a hypnotist. A fine artist, too, he would delight his students
by simultaneously drawing the intricate structueres of the brain with his
left hand while writing their legend with his right. His daughter, Dr.
Tilly Edinger, relates that while sitting for his portrait at a table,
dissecting a brain, he noticed that the artist, Lovis Corinth, was having
difficulties in portraying his convolutions and forthwith came to the canvas
and painted them himself. He was as devoted to art as he was to science
and, like Freud, he always had on his desk some exquisite antique Grecian
figurines.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Throughout his career Edinger pursued the relationship of structure
with function as "to investigate brain anatomy alone is to pursue a sterile
science". He wrote a book on the clinical application of neuro-anatomy
in 1909. He was the first to describe the vertebral and dorsal spinocerebellar
tract and to distinguish the paleoencephalon from the neo- encephalon and
the paleo-cerebellum and neo-cerebellum. Although Gustave Roussy (1874-1948)
and Joseph Jules Dejerine (1849-1917) are usually mentioned when thalamic
pain is discussed, Edinger was the first to describe and verify it at autopsy
some 15 years earlier.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Ludwig Edinger died of a coronary thrombosis post operatively. A study
of his brain, which he often said he hoped someone would undertake, was
made by Heinrich Riese (1864-1928) and Kurt Goldstein (1878-1965); extraordinarily
well-developed occipital lobes as well as other unusual freatures were
observed.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Ludwig Edinger published a large number of papers in Anatomischer Anzeiger,
Neurologisches Centralblatt, and in Virchows Archiv für pathologische
Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin.
<br>&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">&#8220;To investigate brain anatomy alone [and not function] is to pursue
a sterile science.&#8221;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">&#8220;In my work two motives always impelled me. One was my wish to serve
clinical neurology as I came to know it under Leyden, Kussmaul and Erb.
The other was the attempt to understand better its anatomical substratum,
and impart of it what I could to my associates.&#8221;
<br>Wilhelm Krücke, director of the Edinger Institute, at the centenary
jubilee.
