<td><font color="#0000EE">British physician and neurologist, born 31st October, 1886, Geelong,
Victoria, Australia; died 17th March, 1935.
</font>
<hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Adie's syndrome</b> = A condition in which one or both pupils is
dilated and responds slowly or not at all to light and a near stimulus,
accompanied by slow constriction and relaxation in the change from near
to distant vision, and impaired accommodation.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE">William John Adie was born in the harbour city of Geelong, west of Melbourne
on the southern coast of Australia. He received his first education at
Flinder&#8217;s School, but at the age of 13 he had to leave school in order
to support the family, as his father had died in 1899. He worked as an
errand runner in an office. One of his employers recognised his capacity
for learning and paid evening courses for him. Thus he was able to pass
the examination necessary for university entry. One of his topics was German,
which had had learned mostly from visiting sailors. It was a practician
in his native city, Dr. Arthur South, who inspired Adie to embark on a
medical career.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At the time a medical education in Melbourne was very expensive. An
uncle of his in Boston, U.S.A., arranged a £ 19 one-way ticket for
him with the destination England. He was twenty years old at the time.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He soon ended up in Edinburgh, where he, aided by his uncle and a scholarship,
graduated in medicine in 1911. His uncle tried to entice him to come back
to Australia, but Adie liked life in Great Britain and was to spend the
rest of his life there.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He soon took a special interest in neurology, a discipline in which
his knowledge of German came to good use, as he was awarded a postgraduate
travelling scholarship which enabled him to continue his work in Berlin,
Munich, Vienna, and Paris. After about a year he returned to The National
Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic on Queen Square in London.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At the outbreak of World War I Adie joined the Northamptonshire Regiment
and served as a field physician in France, where he took part in the retreat
from Mons, although a timely bout of measles kept him from the battle in
which his regiment was decimated. He was then transferred to the Leicestershire
Regiment and saw extensive active service during the next two years. In
1916 he was mentioned in despatches for saving a number of soldiers in
one of the early gas attacks by improvising a mask of clothing soaked in
urine! He subsequently took charge of the 7th General Hospital, and also
acted as a consultant in the management of head injuries.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1916, while on leave, Adie married Lorraine Bonar, a girl he had
met in Edinburgh. They had two children, a son and a daughter.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">After the war Adie became medical registrar in the Charing Cross Hospital,
London, and eventually joined the staff of the National Hospital for Nervous
Disease, Queen&#8217;s Square and Moorfields Eye Hospital. He was a very able
teacher and diagnostician, treating his students as he would his colleagues.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1925 Adie was at the peak of his career. He was awarded a gold medal
from the University of Edinburgh and even elected Fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At the age of 45 Adie began having problems with angina pectoris. In
1935 he was forced to resign his work, aged only 48. He died from a myocardial
infarct on March 17 that year.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Adie had great intellectual gifts and he was an acute clinical observer
and a fine teacher. He was also a kindly, modest, approachable man and
he was held in high regard by his students. He lived an active life and
had many interests. In particular, he was a keen ornithologist and tennis
player and he enjoyed skiing and skating during his holidays in Switzerland.
His greatness and popularity is well mirrored in the numerous and extensive
obituaries in British Medical Journal and Lancet, among many. In his native
town the youth who had accomplished so much on the other side of the earth
was not forgotten. The daily newspaper Geelon Advertiser wrote a long obituary
under the title &#8221;Geelong boy who made good in London.&#8221;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">With his friend and mentor, James Collier Adie was responsible for the
section on neurology in Price&#8217;s Textbook of Practical Medicine.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Adie also described narcolepsy (Gélineau&#8217;s syndrome):
</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font color="#0000EE">
<i>Idiopathic narcolepsy: a disease sui generis: With remarks on the mechanism
of sleep.</i></li>
