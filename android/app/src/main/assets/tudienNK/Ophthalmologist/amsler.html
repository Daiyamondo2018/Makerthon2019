<p><font color="#0000EE">Marc Amsler was a student of Jules Gonin at the University of Lausanne
and an exponent of Gonin's ideas about retinal detachment repair. He succeeded
Gonin in 1935 as chair of ophthalmology at Lausanne, and in 1944 became
professor at the University of Zurich. He pioneered in the study of aqueous
humor in uveitis and developed an interest in how to monitor macular symptoms
in retinal disease. It seems likely that Amsler got the idea for his patterns
from a small card with a grid pattern that Landolt designed to place in
the center of his perimeter to test the macula. Several devices had been
invented and manufactured by the first half of the 20th century for the
testing of small macular scotomas, but these required an examiner to move
tiny test objects across the grid, sometimes within a stereoscope for greater
precision. These instruments were not so easy to use, and of course did
not document metamorphopsia. Landolt may have intended to describe his
test card in print, but he never did, and his plans for the card are not
known. It appears to have been Amsler's idea to take the grid out of the
perimeter and use it as an independent test, and in doing so Amsler experimented
extensively with different patterns and different colors of grid design.
The authors of one article have stated without references that Amsler was
working on grids as far back as the 1920s, but Alfred Huber, a renowned
Swiss ophthalmologist who was a resident with Amsler in Zurich, has written
that he was actively designing the grids in the period between 1944 and
1952. Huber states that Amsler was "the first to draw attention to the
possibility of this test which still today fortunately has kept its value
in a wonderful way."</font></p></td>
