<td><font color="#0000EE">American ophthalmologist, born 1908, Fall River, Massachusets; died
9th September, 1993, Bethesda.
</font>
<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Cogan's sign </b>= Cogan's lid twitch, in patients with myasthenia.
When the patient's eyes are directed downward for 10 to 20 seconds and
the patient is then instructed to make a vertical saccade back to primary
position, the upper eyelid elevates and either slowly begins to droop or
else twitches several times before settling into a stable position
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Cogan-Reese disease</b> = A syndrome characterized by a matted or
smudged appearance to the surface of the iris, unilateral glaucoma in the
eyes with multiple peripheral anterior synechiae, multiple nodules of the
iris, and ectopic Descemet's membrane.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Cogan's syndrome</b> = Syndrome of interstitial keratitis characterized
by abrupt onset of vertigo, tinnitus, and usually rapid development of
bilateral deafness.
<br>&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>David Glendenning Cogan</b> was born in Fall River, Massachusetts,
where his father was an Episcopal minister. He was introduced to ophthalmology
by his mother, herself a practitioner and a pioneering ophthalmologist.
He attended local school until 1925, when he enrolled at Dartmouth College,
where he combined a collegiate schedule with the first two years of medical
school.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Cogan continued his studies at Harvard Medical School, graduating in
1932. He interned at the University of Chicago and underwent specialty
training in ophthalmology as a resident at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear
Infirmary in Boston. He then went abroad to obtain further experience in
Switzerland, Germany and Holland as a Mosely travelling fellow.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Already in 1934 he succeeded his old mentor Frederick Verhoeff (1874-1968)
as director of the Howe Laboratory of Ophthalmic Research, and he became
Senior Surgeon at the Infirmary. During Cogan's 30-year stewardship the
Howe Laboratory was to have a tremendous influence on ophthalmic research.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In the years between 1955 and his retirement Cogan was Henry Williams
Professor of Ophthalmology at the eye clinic of the Harvard Medical School
university hospital.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Following his mandatory retirement in 1973, aged 65 years, Cogan moved
to the National Institutes of Health, where he continued his research activities.
Despite his age, the tempo of his work continued unabated and he often
put in 10-hour days and 6-day weeks.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">David Cogan in a fruitful way has encouraged the cooperation between
clinicians and scientists of basic research. He initiated and established
the ophthalmological courses of basic science, now a part of specialty
training at almost every medical faculty in the USA. He also introduced
regular appointments for basic research scientists at the eye clinic of
Harvard, thus facilitating the cooperation between scientist and clinician,
setting an example to all major eye clinics in the USA. The fruitful research
climate at his institution has resulted in several of the scientists at
Howe Laboratory receiving more honorary awards than those of any other
eye research laboratory.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Scientifically David Cogan has been very productive, working in many
areas of ophthalmology. As a pathologist he was with the first group of
American medical men going to Hiroshima to examine the effect of radiation
following the atomic explosion. Through his studies of radiation cataracts
he became one of the foremost in this area. He also contributed to the
development of relationships between American and Japanese Ophthalmologists.
He was one of the first ophthalmologists to visit Germany after the Second
World War in an effort to "heal the wounds" and re-establish personal contacts
between ophthalmologists in Germany and the USA. When, in his eighties,
he was invited to be a lecturer of honour with the association of German
ophthalmologists, and rendered his lecture in German.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">It is in neuroophthalmology that David Cogan is internationally best
known. Already in 1948 he published Neurology of the Ocular Muscles, a
book later to go through several editions. The book contains a survey of
various forms of nystagmus still worth reading.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">David Cogan was an influential teacher, cherished by his countless student,
of which several have become prominent. He believed the essence of investigation
was originality, curiosity, and perseverance, and fostered that spirit
in the talented clinicians and basic scientists he recruited to Howe. Despite
his great workload Cogan found time for his family and friends. His home
in the city or in the countryside at Lake Michigan were meeting places
for scientists in ophthalmology.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During his long career Cogan has received many awards. Among them are
the Warren Prize in 1944, Proctor's Award 1954, the Mackenzie medal in
1968, the Research to Prevent Blindness Award 1969 and the Gonin Medallion
1974. In 1985 he was honoured by the dedication of the David G. Cogan Library
at the National Eye Institute. His name also lives on in the Cogan Ophthalmic
History Society and the David Glendenning Cogan Professorship of Ophthalmology,
Harvard Medical School.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During the years 1960 to 1966 he was editor-in-chief of Archives of
Ophthalmology, and a member of the editorial staff of Graefe's Archive
for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology since 1972.
</font>
</p><ul><font color="#0000EE">"So great have been Dr. Cogan's achievements in all three areas &#8211; research,
patient care and education &#8211; that he, more than anyone else, is credited
with transforming the field of ophthalmology from a branch of surgery into
a medical speciality at the forefront of science."
<br>Address at the dedication of the David G. Cogan Library at the National
Eye Institute.
</font>
<p><font color="#0000EE">"To have such a seminal influence on your field is given to very few
people ... how a man could by virtue of his mental agility, skills, and
kindness catapult to the top remains an example and a lesson."&nbsp;
<br>Frederick A. Jakobiec, MD
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">"My connection with other entities to which you refer were similarly
chance observations during a career, now coming to a close, in which I
had an unusually favourable academic position. They were modest contributions
that have reflected undue credit to me because of the eponymic designation.
If, and when, their etiologic origins are clarified they should be classified
by a more appropriate terminology."&nbsp;
<br>This letter, written in his own hand, illustrates Cogan's humble attitude
to his own career.</font></p></ul>
<font color="#0000EE">Cogan was a busy medical author, writing more than 500 articles and several
books.
