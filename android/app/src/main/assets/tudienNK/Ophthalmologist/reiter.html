<td><font color="#0000EE">German bacteriologist and hygienist, born 26th February, 1881, Reudnitz
near Leipzig; died 1969, Hessen.
</font>
<p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Reiter's syndrome</b> = The classic triad consists of conjunctivitis,
urethritis, and arthritis; other characteristic features include heel pain,
skin and mucous membrane lesions, and bone changes. This condition typically
affects young men who are HLA B 27 positive.&nbsp;

<p><font color="#0000EE">Hans Conrad Julius Reiter was born in Leipzig, the son of an industrialist.
He studied medicine first at Leipzig, then Breslau (Wroclaw) and finally
Tübingen, receiving his doctorate on the topic of nephritis and tuberculosis.
Reiter then received further education at the hygienical institute in Berlin,
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and at St. Mary&#8217;s Hospital in London, where
he worked with Sir Almroth Wright for two years. He was subsequently assistant
physician in the lung clinic of the University of Berlin, until in 1913
he became Privatdozent in the institute of hygiene at Königsberg.
Just before the 1st World War he was appointed deputy director of the institute
of hygiene at the University of Berlin.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During four years of World War I Reiter was a military physician, both
on the western front and in Balkan. He was 35 years old and served in the
1st Hungarian army, when he observed the disease picture which has later
been associated with his name.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1918, after World War I, Reiter was appointed chief of department
at the hygienical institute in Rostock, in 1928 first associate professor
with teaching duties in social hygiene, and the same year honorary professor.
Being politically interested, Hans Reiter was a supporter of the Nazi regime.
It did not hurt his career that already in 1932 he signed an oath of allegiance
to Adolf Hitler. In 1933 he was made department director of the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin-Dahlem. In 1936 he
was made director of the health department of the state of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
and later received an honorary professorship in Berlin.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">With Johann Breger he wrote a well-known book on racial hygiene, Deutsches
Gold. Gesundes Leben - frohes Schaffen.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Reiter was an outstanding lecturer who enjoyed great popularity among
his students. His reputation reached far outside Germany, and despite his
enthusiastic support for nazism, he was accorded a number of honours overseas,
including corresponding member of The Royal Society of Medicine i London.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Hans Reiter was also a highly vital elderly gentleman. At the age of
80 he lectured at international congresses on rheumatology. After his retirement
he lived on his country estate in Hessen until his death in 1969.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Whilst serving on the western front Reiter was the first to identify
the spirochete causing Weil&#8217;s disease. He also isolated a non-pathogenic
variety of Treponema pallidum. This variant supplied many laboratories
throughout the world with the antigen used in Reiter&#8217;s complement fixation
test for syphilis.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Reiter and his disease</b>
<br>Over the years different variations of the disease picture in Reiter
disease have been described by a number of authors who have applied almost
a hundred synonyms. Urethritis in association with arthritis was described
as early as in the 16th century, and the term polyartrithis enterica was
introduced in the latter half of the 19th century. The first to describe
the complete triad was the English surgeon Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie
(1783-1862). He included five cases in his textbook Pathological and Surgical
Observations on Diseases of the Joints (London, 1818). All Brodie&#8217;s patients
were men.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1916 the condition was described independently of Reiter by Fiessinger
and Leroy. In 1941, 25 years after his original description, Hans Reiter
&#8211; in all modesty &#8211; refers to the condition as Reiter&#8217;s syndrome. In French
literature, however, the term Fiessinger and Leroy syndrome, or Fiessinger-Leroy-Reiter
syndrome is used.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Reiter reported a young lieutenant who was admitted to the Reservelasarett
X on October 14, 1916. The patient was acutely ill with high fever and
bloody diarrhoea, and developed urethritis, arthritis, and conjunctivitis.
After venous puncture spirochetes were demonstrated in pure culture, and
Reiter first thought it was spirochaetal in origin, but revised his opinion
later. He described the case that year in Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift
under the title of Eine bisher unbekannte Spirochäteninfektion (Spirochaetosis
arthritica).
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Reiter himself did not consider the case a great rarity, writing: There
is reason to believe that many similar disease cases have occurred and
that they are spread all over the country.
