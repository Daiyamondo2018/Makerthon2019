<td><font color="#0000EE">&nbsp;German anatomist and pathologist, born 19th July, 1809, Fürth,
near Nuremberg, Bavaria; died 13th May, 1885, Göttingen.
</font>

</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">A student and the closest co-worker of Johannes Müller (1801-1858),
<b>Friedrich Gustav Jacob Henle</b> helped prepare the way for cytology
through his studies of epithelia. He created the first histology based
on extensive microscopical investigations, and, through his theory of miasma
and contagion, was among the precursors of modern microbiology.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">A follower of Xavier Bichat's (1771-1892) pioneer work in microscopic
anatomy, Henle became the greatest histologist of his day and one of the
finest anatomists of any area. His importance to the development of histology
is comparable to that of the Renaissance master Andreas Vesalius on gross
anatomy. A man of wide interests, equally at home with the arts as with
science, Henle led a life filled with politics, romance, and intrigue.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle was born of Jewish parents at Fürth near Nuremberg. His father,
Wilhelm Henle, was a merchant; his mother, Helena Sophia Diespeck, was
the daughter of a rabbi. The social position of a Jewish family in the
small town of Fürth was rather circumscribed, but increasing economic
prosperity finally made possible relations with cultured circles. Henle
received his first instruction at home from a private tutor; later he attended
the Gymnasium at Mainz and Koblenz. His education was directed primarily
toward classical and modern languages; he was also a good draftsman and
was musically talented. In 1820 he suffered an attack of periostitis; it
subsided but often recurred. After the family had converted to the evangelical
belief in 1821, Henle for a time thought of becoming a minister. Medicine
was not considered until, in Koblenz, he met Johannes Müller socially
at a home musicale.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle began his medical studies in October 1827 at the University of
Bonn, where he became a member of the Burschenschaft (student&#8217;s association)
in the fall of 1829. Soon afterward, disappointed by the unkind behaviour
of other students, he severed this connection by continuing his studies
at the University of Heidelberg in the spring of 1830.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle&#8217;s continuing interest in anatomical investigations was rewarded
by Müller&#8217;s inviting him on a trip to Paris, where they met Baron
Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) and René Dutrochet (1776-1847). In the
Jardin des plantes he studied the anatomy of fish. Henle received the M.D.
on April 4, 1832 at Bonn with a dissertation on the pupil membrane and
the blood vessels within the eye. In March 1833 he passed the state medical
examination in Berlin and immediately became an assistant to Müller,
who in April 1833 was named professor of anatomy and physiology at Berlin.
In 1834 Henle followed to become Müller&#8217;s prosector at the Anatomical
Institute.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Being politically active was a pursuit definitely not without its dangers
in the decades following the Napoleonic wars. A first attempt to qualify
as lecturer failed for political reasons, since all former members of the
Burschenschaft were suspected of being enemies of the state. In 1835 Henle
was arrested for this reason and detained in the Hausvogtein in Berlin
to await trial, but through the intervention of Alexander von Humboldt
(1769-1859) and others he was released from confinement after four weeks.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Meanwhile he lost his post as prosector and, following a long investigation,
was condemned to six years in prison in January 1837, yet within a few
weeks he was pardoned and thus could return to his post. In the same year
he qualified as lecturer in Berlin, receiving the Venia legendi for his
famous habilitation thesis, and was allowed to teach. This was the time
when the doctrine of the cell by Mathias Schleiden (1804-1881) and Theodor
Schwann (1810-1882) revolutionised biology, and for Henle the acquaintance
of these two giants contributed to make his period in Berlin particularly
fertile.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1840 Henle moved to Zürich to become professor of anatomy, later
also of physiology. At Zurich Albert Kölliker (1817-1905) was his
prosector. It was in Zurich, in 1841, Henle published his most important
book, <i>Allgemeine Anatomie</i> [General Anatomy], which is the first
systematic work on histology. The book made him world famous and is epoch-making
for several reasons, among them his recognition of the cell theories of
Schwann, which were of basic importance to his own work, and the fact that
it was thoroughly based on the latest and most fundamental scientific knowledge.
In Zürich he also founded what was to become one of the most important
journals in the German language, the <i>Zeitschrift für rationelle
Medicin</i>, a product that emerged from his close friendship with the
clinician Karl von Pfeufer (1806-1869)
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1844 Henle left Zürich for Heidelberg to teach anatomy, anthropology
and physiology as second professor, along with Friedrich Tiedemann (1781-1861).
When the latter retired as emeritus, Henle also took over the direction
of the Anatomical Institute, of which he was in charge from 1848 to 1852.
That year he commenced his last tenure, succeeding the diseased Konrad
Johann Martin Langenbeck (1776-1851) in the chair of anatomy and the directorship
of the institute of anatomy in Göttingen, where he was active until
his death 33 years later, in 1885.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Whilst in Heidelberg he wrote <i>Handbuch der rationellen Pathologie</i>
(Handbook of Rational Pathology) (1846-1853). The books described diseased
organs in relation to their normal physiological functions, and represents
the beginning of modern pathology.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Very revealing of the romantic and sentimental young Henle is his first
marriage. During his stay in Zurich he fell in love with Elise Egloff,
who worked as a governess in the house of his friends; he set her up in
her own lodgings and later arranged for his sister to educate her and give
her social polish. They were married in March 1846. One son and one daughter
resulted from this union, which ended barely two years later with his wife&#8217;s
death from tuberculosis. In August 1849 Henle married Marie Richter, the
daughter of a Prussian officer; they had four daughters and one son.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle belonged to many scientific organizations, including the Leopoldine
Academy, the Belgian Academy of Medicine (honorary member), the Bavarian
Academy of Sciences of Munich (foreign member), the Berlin Academy (corresponding
member), the Petersburg Academy of Medicine (honorary member), and the
Royal Academy of Sciences (Amsterdam). He received a high order from the
Prussian government, as well as the title of privy superior medical counsellor
(geheimer Ober-Medicinalrath).&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Seldom is anyone introduced to scientific work as Henle was. Johannes
Müller began to edit the <i>Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie
und wissenschaftliche Medicin</i> in 1834, and it became a clearinghouse
for studies oriented toward the natural sciences. Henle assumed the major
share of the work of editing it and thus became familiar with current topics
of biology. After undertaking comparative anatomical studies on the electric
organ of the ray and on annelids, he soon turned his attention to increasingly
precise microscopical research. Hints had been accumulating from all sides
regarding the smallest structural elements of plant and animal organisms.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The concept of the cell first became current among the botanists but
was quickly extended to animals as well. Along with Gabriel Valentin (1810-1883),
Henle was among the first authors to use the term «cell».&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">It was in Berlin during the years of 1832 to 1834 that Henle published
the first descriptions of the structure and distribution of human epithelial
tissue and of the fine structures of the eye and brain. Henle&#8217;s study of
the larynx, which was highly praised by Humboldt, was a completely independent
comparative anatomical work.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In the last period of his activity in Berlin he studied problems in
pathology that he had encountered in his editorial work on Müller&#8217;s
Archiv. By far the most important of these was his article (1840) <i>Von
den Miasmen und Kontagien</i> (On Miasmas and Contagions and on the Miasmatic-Contagious
Diseases), in which he embraced the unpopular micro organism theory of
contagion put forth by the Renaissance forerunner of modern epidemiology,
Girolamo Fracastoro (1478-1553). At this time the term miasma was used
for causes of disease that acted on the body from the outside, while contagia
acted on or in the body itself. But sharp boundaries between these two
should not exist, since diseases originating from miasma could become contagious.
Most important was the knowledge that the carriers of disease were actually
living material and that therefore the contagium, like a parasite, colonized
the host body. As a result of its own powers of reproduction, even a small
group of contagia suffices to cause s specific disease. Henle stated: "The
material of contagions is not only an organic but a living one and is indeed
endowed with a life of its own, which is, in relation to the diseased body,
a parasite organism.&#8221; Henle had observed microorganisms in the excretions
of diseased animals but was not able to prove that they were a direct cause
of the disease. Such ideas, although not absolutely new, were often considered
unworthy of belief; it required more than thirty years for their acceptance.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Among Henle's students at the University of Göttingen (1852-1885)
was Robert Koch, who was to provide definite proof of Henle's belief in
microbes.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1837 Henle presented as his Habilitationsschrift an investigation
of the epithelium of the intestinal villi, which demonstrated that he was
already one of the leading experts in this field of histology. The extent
of his progress is also shown by his lecture of February 16, 1838, to the
Hufelandsche Medicinisch-Chirurgische Gesellschaft on mucus and pus formation.
He consistently called the structural elements of the epithelium «cells»;
he also described the epithelium of the urinary bladder as a form intermediate
between the cylindrical and the pavement epithelium. He reported on the
extension of the epithelia in the human body in 1838, distinguishing three
types: pavement, cylindrical (columnar), and ciliated. Moreover, he established
that they cover all the liquid free surfaces of the body, all the inner
surfaces of its canals and ducts, and all the walls of its cavities.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">An important work of its time was Henle&#8217;s i&gt;Handbuch der retionellen
Pathologie. It stems chiefly from his years at Heidelberg and presents
pathology, one of the fundamentals of the physician's activity, again as
resting on scientific knowledge; previously medicine - at least in German-speaking
areas - was practiced for several decades primarily in the light of Naturphilosophie.
Of still greater importance was his Handbuch der systematischen Anatomie.
Composed in Göttingen over a period of sixteen years, it contains
the entire contemporary knowledge of the structure of the human body and
a multitude of good illustrations. If the presentation of the central nervous
system is disregarded, the work may still be useful for orientation in
the subject of gross human anatomy and its occasional variations. It did
not become obsolete as a textbook until the fundamental approach to anatomy
gained dominance.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle&#8217;s name is best known today for the loop-shaped portion of the
nephron named for him. His observation of it in 1862, supported by isolation
preparations, was correct in itself but the interpretation was completely
wrong: according to Henle, there were two loop-shaped tubules, each of
which was connected at one end to a different renal corpuscle. Nevertheless,
his study resulted in a new series of investigations on the kidneys through
which, between 1863 and 1865, their structure was definitely determined.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">His explanation of metastasis in cancer was the forerunner of Virchow's
cellular pathology.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle was a superb lecturer, a poet and a fine musician, playing the
violin, viola and violin cello. He maintained it was a physician's duty
to prevent and cure disease, that disease is a deviation from normal physiological
processes and death the cessation of metabolism. He had a wide circle of
friends, including the composer Felix Mendelssohn (1809-1847) and Humboldt.
In his last years countless honours were bestowed on him; the Universities
of Breslau made honorary doctor of philology, the University of Edinburgh
conferred him Dr. of common law.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle&#8217;s health often hindered his activity, since sliver was frequently
discharged at the site of the periostitis; he also suffered from neuralgia.
He died of renal and spinal sarcoma.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Henle was very sociable. He loved witty conversations, encouraged home
musicals and evening gatherings for reading, and was happy to open his
house for concerts. His political ideas were liberal and nationalistic,
but he was unable to become reconciled to Prussia&#8217;s domestic politics.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">For his students he was the beloved «der alte Jacob», which
he was also called. Hardly any part of the human body escaped his investigative
curiosity.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">«I have shown, then, that the infective material must be independently
alive, and thought to consist of organisms - either plant or animal - or
of parts of animals which have achieved a limited independence.»
