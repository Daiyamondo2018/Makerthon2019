<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">Jonathan Hutchinson (1828-1913) was
a surgeon, eye-surgeon, neurologist, syphilologist and dermatologist, writer
and teacher. Born a Quaker at Selby where his father was a merchant, he
served his medical apprenticeship with Caleb Williams in York before moving
in 1850 to St Bartholomew's in London to complete his training. After a
brief return to York for his House Surgeon's post he came back to London,
studying ophthalmology at Moorfields and striving to learn "all he could
in all branches of medicine". For a while medical journalism was his only
source of income; by 1855 he was on the staff of the<i> Medical Times and
Gazette, </i>the main competitor of the <i>Lancet</i> and edited by Thomas
Spencer Wells.</font><font color="#0000EE"> </font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">He put up his plate at 14 Finsbury
Circus in the year he married (1856), and became the paid Secretary of
the New Sydenham Society. It was through this Society that he published
his atlases of Skin Diseases and Drug Eruptions. In 1859 he was appointed
Assistant Surgeon to the London Hospital, achieving the FRCS three years
later and in 1863 was promoted to full surgeon.</font><font color="#0000EE">
</font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">Though his surgery was mainly conducted
at the London, he was an eye surgeon at Moorfields and neurology and ophthalmology
both intrigued him. Earlier he had studied with James Startin at his newly
founded Skin Hospital at Blackfriars and once on the staff, it provided
his centre for dermatology and syphilology. Soon he became pre-eminent
and Blackfriars emerged as the postgraduate skin centre.</font><font color="#0000EE">
</font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">He edited the British Medical Journal
for one year and from 1877 to 1888 produced the two volumes of his <i>Atlas
Illustrating Clinical Surgery</i>. His "one man" publication - the Archives
of Clinical Surgery (to be seen today in the Willan library) - appeared
from 1889 until 1900 and is well worth a look. He claimed he had no time
to write any systematic book, but he made meticulous notes, and incomparable
data are available on his numerous patients, many of dermatological interest.
Scadding<sup>29</sup> referred to these Archives while pursuing the earliest
recognition of sarcoidosis; he found that Mrs Mortimer's Malady had been
termed by Hutchinson <i>"lupus vulgaris multiplex non-ulcerans"</i>.</font><font color="#0000EE">
</font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">Hutchinson's amazingly retentive
memory, coupled with his genius for teaching, enabled him to fascinate
large audiences on a multiplicity of subjects. He attained a unique status.
With his tall, stooping frame, his untidy black beard and his slow speech
he presented an austere, seemingly humourless figure. It might seem amazing
that such a solemn man could enthral his audiences but this is precisely
what he did. In 1893 he opened, at his own expense, a Clinical Museum at
1 Park Crescent, and transferred it to a house in Chenies Street in 1898.
The notice outside read: "<i>The Medical Graduate College and Polyclinic;
lectures to be given at 5.15 pm"</i>. It can be regarded as the fore-runner
of London's Postgraduate Medical School. His collection of drawings and
<i>memorabilia</i>, later established as a museum at his home in Haslemere,
was sold to William Osler, transported across the Atlantic, and presented
to the Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore.</font><font color="#0000EE">
</font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">An incomparable Syphilologist, he
described his triad of notched incisor teeth, labyrinthine deafness and
interstitial keratitis, and so provided a firm diagnosis long before the
<i>Treponema pallidum</i> or the Wassermann reaction were recognized. It
was well-known to all students.</font><font color="#0000EE"> </font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">He was elected President of the London
(Third) International Dermatological Congress in 1896 and his Presidential
address is quoted in full in the eighth volume of his Archives (October
1896). A perceptive extract is:- "If we ask how the most rapid development
has come about the answer must be: By the aid of cheap printing and cheap
travelling. We are now able to communicate easily one with another and
to make mental use of each other's brains. A six hour journey will now
enable a Londoner to visit, what I may fairly claim to be the Cradle of
Dermatological Science - the<i> Hôpital St Louis."</i></font><font color="#0000EE">
</font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">His presence was the one redeeming
feature of this international meeting, which otherwise brought London little
kudos, as our own high-class academics were so sparse and our facilities
so inadequate.</font><font color="#0000EE"> </font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">He recognized an array of entities
- <i>varicella gangrenosa, </i>the tabetic or Hutchinson's mask, Summer
eruption <i>(hydroa vacciniforme), angioma serpiginosum</i>, notched incisor
teeth, <i>corneal salmon patch, choroiditis</i> and <i>circinate retinopathy.</i></font><font color="#0000EE">
</font>
</p><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times" color="#0000EE">He staunchly maintained his theory
about the cause of leprosy which he attributed to the consumption of decaying
fish, this even after the causal organism had been demonstrated. It was
his one "blind spot"; nevertheless he remained a good friend of Gerhard
Hansen, the Norwegian leprologist at Bergen. His book on<i> Leprosy and
fish eating </i>was published in 1906.</font></p></td>
