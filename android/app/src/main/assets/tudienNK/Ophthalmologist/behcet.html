</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE">Hulusi Behçet was born when Istanbul was still the capital of
the Ottoman Empire, &#8221;the sick man of Europe.&#8221; His father, Ahmet Behçet,
was a well-known businessman who was among the friends of Mustafa Kemal
Atatürk, the founder of Turkish Republic. Hulusi Behçet lost
his mother when he was a child and he was raised by his grandmother.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He got his primary education in Damascus because of his father's business
affairs there. He learned French, Latin and German as a native speaker.
Behçet pursued his education at Gülhane Military Medical Academy
in Istanbul, graduating at the age of 21 in 1910. He subsequently specialized
in dermatology and venereal diseases.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During the war of 1914-1918 he served at the Edirne Military Hospital
as a specialist in dermatology and venereal diseases and an assistant to
the head of the hospital. After the war between 1918-1919, he first went
to Budapest and then to Berlin's Charité Hospital to improve his
medical knowledge.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Behçet never thought of living in Europe, however, and after
his return to Turkey he commenced a private clinic in Cagaloglu. Then in
1923 he was appointed as the head medical doctor at the Hasköy Venereal
Diseases Hospital. Six months later, he moved to Guraba Hospital, which
is now part of the Istanbul Medical College, as a dermatologist.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1923, the year of the establishment of the Turkish Republic, he married
Refika Davaz, who was sister of one his patients. His wife was the daughter
of a famous diplomat, which led him to accept many patients from high society
of Istanbul.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During the university reform in Turkey, Hulusi Behçet was appointed
professor to the clinic of dermatology and syphilis in 1933, receiving
the degree of ordinarius in 1939. He held his professorship for 14 years,
until 1947. He was the first person in Turkish academic life that received
the title of professor.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He had been interested in syphilis since 1922 and he had published many
international articles on its diagnosis, treatment, hereditary properties,
serology and social aspects.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He translated many articles into Turkish to help educate new generations,
and he was in the publishing vanguard to improve Turkish medicine. In 1924
he was responsible for the establishment of the first dermato-venerology
journal of Turkey called Turkish Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology.
In 1939, he was elected as a correspondent member to the German journals
<i>Dermatologische
Wochenschrift</i> (Hamburg) and <i>Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift</i>
(Berlin). He was for several years one of the editors of Dermatologische
Wochenschrift&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Behçet&#8217;s most important contribution to medical literature was
the monograph published in 1940 called Clinical and Practical Syphilis,
Diagnosis and Related Dermatoses. Every page of this book contains an aspect
of syphilis and the footnotes, provides a wealth of detailed information
about the differential diagnosis of other skin diseases. This book, despite
its outdated style, still retains its value and spirit in medicine as being
the only example in its field.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Behçet was a retiring, shy man who was well regarded by all of
his colleagues. He was deeply interested in the arts, particularly literature.
Generally he was nervous and suffered from insomnia, colitis and angina
pectoris, but sometimes he was joyful and good-humoured among friends.
Among them were the French dermatologist Henri Gougerot (1881-1955), Prof.
Dr. Cartoud, and several distinguished Turkish physicians.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He was divorced from his wife seven years before his death from a sudden
heart attack on March 8, 1948.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Behçet was troubled with ill health throughout his life, with
chronic insomnia, spastic colitis and heart trouble. A heavy smoker, he
fell ill with angina pectoris and respiratory insufficiency, and died of
myocardial infarction in 1948, at the age of only 59.</font></p></td>
