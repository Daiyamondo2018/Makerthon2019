<p><font color="#0000EE">Henri Parinaud was born in modest circumstances, the son of a poor locksmith,
his education was hampered after the age of 19 when his father died so
that he had to provide not only for his own education but for assistance
for his widowed mother and his brothers to obtain the necessities of life.
Nevertheless, he succeeded and studied medicine first at Limoges and then
went to Paris (1869). In his first year in that city the Franco-Prussian
war (1970-1) broke out, during which he served with unusual bravery in
a Red Cross ambulance and thereafter returned to Paris. Here his thesis
on optic neuritis in acute meningitis in children attracted the attention
of Charcot at the Salpetriere and so he was tempted into the problems of
neuro-ophthalmology, particularly those affecting the ocular motor system.
In this connection his studies on multiple sclerosis, ophthalmoplegic migraine
and hysteria were particularly noteworthy as well as those on supranuclear
lesions causing conjugate paralysis of vertical movements and lesions in
the midbrain causing disjunctive disturbances of the ocular motility and
paralyses and spasms of convergence and divergence. This led to his work
on concomitant squint which he conceived as primarily due to a sensory
impediment of binocular vision and as activated by a disturbance of convergence
and divergence. But his interest was not confined to neurology; Parinaud's
oculo-glandular syndrome is well known as well as his studies of lacrimal
infections and Parinaud's dermo-lipomata and his contributions to surgery
particularly in cataract, glaucoma and ptosis. The physiology of vision
also claimed his attention and his name is closely associated with the
role of the visual receptors, the light sense, night-blindness and colour
vision. Never physically strong and never wealthy but always absorbed in
work, running a gratuitous clinic to which students were attracted from
all over the world, all the time he remained an extremely modest and endearing
individual, seeking no fame; his hobby was music on which he published
several works under the pseudonym Pierre Erick.
