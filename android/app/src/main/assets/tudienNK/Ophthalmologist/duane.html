<td><font color="#0000EE">American ophthalmologist, born September 1, 1858, Malone, New York;
died June 10, 1926.
</font>
<p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Duane's syndrome</b> = The characteristic lid narrowing and retraction
of the globe on adduction, caused by simultaneous contraction of the medial
and lateral rectus muscles, help identify the condition. Duane's retraction
syndrome is frequently mistaken for a sixth-nerve palsy in infancy because
of deficient abduction of the involved eye. In fact, as a cause of limited
abduction Duane's syndrome is quite common in children, so it must be kept
in mind.&nbsp;

<p><font color="#0000EE">Alexander Duane was one of the first investigators in ophthalmology
with a special interest in accommodation and squint. He was born into a
prominent family in Molone, New York. His father was the army general James
Duane and his boyhood was spent moving between various postings. He was
educated at the Union College, Cincinnati, where he gained many academic
rewards and thereafter studied medicine at the College of Physicians and
Surgeons, New York, which later became the medical school of Columbia University.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">After graduation in 1881 Duane interned at the New York Hospital and
was educated in eye medicine by the German-born American ophthalmologist
Hans Jakob Knapp (1832-1911). He specialised in this discipline and commenced
ophthalmological practice in New York in 1884. For a brief period he taught
ophthalmology at the Cornell University.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During his boyhood his mother, a woman of considerable literary abilities,
gave him extensive instruction in the English language. He put this knowledge
to use during his internship when he developed an interest in lexicography
and supplied medical terms for several standard dictionaries. Duane also
received training in mathematics from his father and he applied these skills
to an analysis of the movements of the extraocular muscles, publishing
a classic account of motor abnormalities in 1896.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">His work in this field, together with his investigations of accommodation
and refraction, represent his great contribution to the science of ophthalmology.
Still, perhaps, he was most noted for his translations of the textbook
by the Viennese authority Ernst Fuchs, which appeared in English in 1903
under the title of Fuchs Textbook of Ophthalmology and ran into eight editions.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During the Spanish-American War Duane served in the US Navy as a signal
officer, and in the Great War on the American ship Granite State. He was
also the author of a monograph entitled Rules for signalling on land and
sea which was first published in 1899.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Duane received an honorary doctorate of science from his university
and was elected chairman of the ophthalmological section of the American
Medical Association in 1917.&nbsp;
