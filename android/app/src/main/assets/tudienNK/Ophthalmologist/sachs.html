<td><font color="#0000EE">American neurologist, born January 2, 1858, Baltimore, Maryland; died
1944
</font>
<p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Tay-Sachs disease</b> = an autosomal recessive disorder involving
the lysozymal enzymes. The result is neuronal degeneration and cherry red
spot of the eyes. Death occurs before 3 years of age.
</font>
</p><p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<p><font color="#0000EE">Bernard Sachs&#8217; parents were of Jewish descent. His father was a teacher
who had grown up in a small town in Bavaria near Schweinfurth. Whilst studying
in Würzburg, he eloped with a girlfriend to Hamburg in 1847 and boarded
a ship to the U.S.A. They had six children.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Although he early decided to pursue a medical career, Bernard Sachs
first concentrated his studies on literature and the classics. He studied
at Harvard Medical College in Cambridge from 1874 to 1878. One of his teachers,
the psychologist and philosopher William James (1842-1910), was having
trouble with his eyes and asked a member of the class to read a chapter
from Wilhelm Wundt&#8217;s Psychology. Sachs undertook this task and this aroused
his interest in the study of mental disorders.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Sachs graduated B.A. from Harvard with honours in 1878 and went to Europe
where he studied medicine in Strassburg, Vienna, and Berlin. He chose Strassburg
because of the strong medical faculty at the time. He was most impressed
by Adolf Kussmaul (1822-1902) but also found von Fredrich Daniel Recklinghausen
(1833-1910) an inspiring teacher. Sachs quoted a comment of Wilhelm von
Waldeyer-Hartz (1836-1921) who did not like any of the textbooks of anatomy
except Josef Hyrtls (1810-1894) because &#8220;it contains anecdotes: you will
remember the anecdotes and promptly forget the anatomy.&#8221;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">While working with Friedrich Leopold Goltz (1834-1902) Sachs wrote his
first paper which appeared in Virchow&#8217;s Archiv für pathologische Anatomie
und Physiologie und für klinische Medicin in 1882. He visited and
worked with Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833-1890) and Rudolf Virchow
in Berlin. After receiving his degree from the University of Vienna in
1882 Sachs, along with fellow student Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), remained
to continue postgraduate studies in cerebral anatomy and neuropsychiatry
with Theodor Hermann Meynert (1833-1892). Later, in 1885, Sachs translated
Meynert&#8217;s classic treatise Psychiatrie.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">To round off his education in medicine and neurological science Sachs
spent a year with Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) in Paris and John Hughlings
Jackson (1835-1911) in London.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Sachs sailed back to the U.S.A. in 1884 to live in New York, where his
parents had settled. He spent three years in New York as an assistant to
Isaac Adler (1849-1918), before establishing a private practice for the
treatment of mental and nervous diseases. In 1887 Sachs, now recognized
as one of America&#8217;s leading clinical neurologists, became an instructor
at the New York Polyclinic Hospital.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At this stage he wrote his article on arrested cerebral development
with special referance to its cortical pathology, in which a cherry red
macula had been noted clinically by his associate Herman Jakob Knapp (1832-1911).
Later on, recognising the familial nature of the condition, he called the
disorder &#8220;amaurotic familial idiocy&#8221;. He was unaware that Tay had already
published an account of brownish-red circular spot in each macula surrounded
by a whote halo in an infant. Tay considered the change to be similar to
the picture of embolism of the central artery of the retina. Hughlings
Jackson had been called as a consultant and was unable to find any evidence
of cerebral problems. Later it was recognised that Tay and Sachs were seeing
different facets of the same condition.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1893 he was appointed consultative neurologist at Mount Sinai Hospital
in New York and consulting physician to Manhattan State Hospital. At Mount
Sinai he helped arrange for the establishment of a neurological bed service,
the first separate division of its kind in a New York health facility.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Sachs was an intelligent man with a strong sense of humour. He was outspoken
and could be very sharp in repartee, but he was also a very generous man.
As a neuro-psychiatrist he was often called to court cases and in his autobiography
tells the story of a lady who was suffering from senile dementia and who
had left most of her money to the lawyer who had drawn up her will. &#8220;I
suppose&#8217;, asked the cross-examining lawyer, &#8220;that it is very easy for you,
Dr. Sachs to tell whether a person is sane or insane. I presume you can
tell by looking at me whether I am sane or insane.&#8217; Very promptly I answered
&#8216;Not by looking, but possibly by listening to you.&#8217; That settled him.&#8221;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He had a lucrative private practice but he lost most of his money when
the stock market collapsed. Gradually, however, he regained his losses
to become a philantrophist and art collector.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Sachs published almost 200 articles and several books including The
Normal Child (1926) wherein he largely advocated that parents should be
guided by common sense and not pyschological theories, and in which he
particularly attacked Freudian pyschology. This followed an earlier work
directed at the medical profession rather than the lay public, Nervous
and Mental Disorders From Birth Through Adolescence.
