<br>John Dalrymple was the eldest son of the famous surgeon William Dalrymple
(1772-1847) in Norwich. He received his first medical education from his
father, before entering the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated
in medicine in 1827. That year he also became a member of the Royal College
of Surgeons and settled in practice in London where he was active as an
eye surgeon.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1832 he became assistant surgeon at the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital,
becoming a surgeon in 1843. He became Fellow of the Royal Society in 1850,
1851 Member of the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Dalrymple was also a skilled microscopist and histologist, and it was
in these respects he plays a role in the case of Thomas McBean (the first
patient with Bence Jones Protein). It should be noted that he was the first
to publish on this special case.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Despite his rather frail health he attracted many patients, but ill
health forced him to retire from the hospital in 1847, only 47 years of
age. He lived alone on Grosvenor Street in Mayfair. He died from kidney
failure only weeks after the publication of his magnum opus on the pathology
of the eye in 1852. A compilation of his scientific works is found in the
Catalogue of Scientific Papers of the Royal Society.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Dalrymple contributed to ophthalmological literature with two large
works, published in 1834 and 1852. John Dalrymple played an important part
in the discovery of the albumin now called Bence Jones&#8217; protein. See under
Henry Bence Jones, English physician and chemist, 1813-1873.
