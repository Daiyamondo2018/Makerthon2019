<p><font color="#0000EE">Edward Treacher Collins was the son of Dr. W. J. Collins, a London physician,
and a Miss Treacher who came from an old Huguenot family. He was given
his mother&#8217;s maiden name as a forename and, in accordance with the custom
of the time, used the doubled-barrelled surname without a hyphen. He went
to school at University College and entered Middlesex Hospital in 1879,
graduating in 1883. Influenced by his older brother, Sir William Collins,
a distinguished ophthalmologist, he pursued a career in this speciality.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1884 he interned at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields,
where he spent the next 48 years. In 1886 he was appointed pathologist
and curator of the hospital&#8217;s museum. He remained in this position until
1895 when he was appointed surgeon to the hospital. His work as a pathologist
at the hospital formed the basis of his lectures and a book which he published
in 1896 called Researches into the Anatomy and Pathology of the Eye. His
publication attracted people from America and Europe as well as the United
Kingdom to the hospital to work with him.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He also lectured at the Charing Cross Hospital Medical School as well
as 1894 and 1899 at the Royal College of Surgeon.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1895 he was married to a New Zealander and spent a romantic honeymoon
in Persia in Ispahan where he had been asked to treat the elder son of
the reigning shah, Prince Izel a'Sultan and was awarded the Lion and the
Sun decoration in appreciation of his services.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Apart from his diverse scientific interests, in his early days he had
been an excellent rugby player and was an outstanding horse rider, following
the Queen&#8217;s Buck Hounds, just as his father had done and was a skilful
sketcher and painter and illustrated much of his work.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Treacher Collins was noted for his industry, persistence and clarity
of thought. He is said to have preferred investigation for its possible
application and utility rather than purely for the love of discovery. He
applied his mind to each problem in a careful and methodical manner, but
once he had worked it out and decided upon a hypothesis based upon his
facts, he was said to be very difficult to shift, even when evidence was
produced which seemed to make his explanation unlikely. His dogmatism,
although perhaps a drawback for scientific advancement, was an advantage
in his teaching. He was said to be somewhat dour in appearance but had
a fine sense of humour and was a witty after-dinner speaker. He did much
both on the national and international scene in development of ophthalmology.
He was a leading figure in the organisation of the British Ophthalmological
Society as well as the international council of ophthalmology and in 1927
he was elected president. He occupied the office with distinction in the
difficult period of post-war conciliation, aided by his charm and flair.
