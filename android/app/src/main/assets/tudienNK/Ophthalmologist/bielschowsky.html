died 5th April 1940, New York.

<p><font color="#0000EE">Alfred Bielschowsky was born to a Jewish family in Namslau, Lower Silesia.
He graduated from the Königliches Katholisches Gymnasium zu Glatz
in 1889 and then entered the study of medicine at the university of Breslau.
He soon moved on to Heidelberg, where he graduated in 1891. During the
first terms of clinical education he was influenced by the lectures of
Theodor Leber (1840-1917).
</font>
</p><p>
</p><hr size="3" width="400">
<font color="#0000EE">
<br>Bielschowsky continued his education at the University of Berlin, attending
the lectures of Karl Ernst Theodor Schweigger (1830-1905). He obtained
his doctorate in surgery at Berlin in 1893, and received his medical license
&#8211; Ärztliche Approbation &#8211; in Leipzig on March 1, 1893. He then served
one year in military service.&nbsp;
</font>
<p><font color="#0000EE">He spent his hospital service and assistant period at the university
eye clinic in Leipzig, where he received education in ophthalmology under
Carl Hubert Sattler (1880&#8211;) and in 1900 was habilitated as Privatdozent
in ophthalmology. In Leipzig he worked under the physiologist Ewald Hering,
who headed the physiological institute next to the eye clinic. In the physiological
institute he became acquainted with Frans Bruno Hofmann (1869-1926), and
the two made fundamental work on the fusion and cyclodeviation in obliquus
superior pareses, and congenital hyperfunction of the obliquus superior.
At this time he also developed a lasting friendship with his colleague
Emil Krückmann (1865-1944).
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Following his habilitation, Bielschowsky proved himself an outstanding
university teacher and scientist, becoming ausserordentlicher professor
in 1906. From 1906 to 1912 he was head physician in the Leipzig eye clinic.
In Leipzig, Bielschowsky married Frieda Johanna Blume, the daughter of
an advisor to the supreme court , the Reichsgericht. They had three children
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1912 he was called to the chair of ophthalmology at the University
of Marburg, heading the university eye clinic.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">During World War I, Bielschowsky was busy attending to severely wounded
and blinded. In 1915 he established a 35 bed ward for soldiers who had
been blinded by shell splinters or poison gas. Realising that medical rehabilitation
was not sufficient, he hired the young student Carl Strehl to teach the
blinded soldiers Braille, a system of reading and writing that enables
the blind to see by using their sense of touch. It is named for the French
pedagogue Louis Braille (1809-1852). His wife, too, participated in the
education of the blinded.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">It is to a large degree due to his efforts and organisational skills
that the Deutsche Blindenstudienanstalt was established in Marburg. With
Strehl, Bielschowsky founded the "Verein blinder Akademiker Deutschlands"
(the Association of Blinded German Academicians.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1923 he moved to the chair in Breslau. It was here, in 1932, he published
his epoch-making work Die Lähmungen der Augenmuskeln, still a standard
work og motility disturbances of the muscles of the eye.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">For his contributions during the war, Bielschowsky was honoured with
the Iron Cross for War Aid (Eisernes Kreuz der Kriegshilfe) from Reichsmarschall
Paul von Hindenburg, and was awarded the title of Geheimer Medizinalrat
(Privy Medical Counsellor) by Emperor Wilhelm II. However, all this was
of no significance when the National Socialist Party &#8211; Nationalsozialistische
Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, the Nazis &#8211; came to power in 1933. Because of
his Jewish origin he was fired as head of the Breslau eye clinic already
the following year.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1936, Bielschowsky emigrated to the United States of America and
settled in Dartmouth, New Hampshire. In America, his knowledge and outstanding
didactic abilities were received with enthusiasm. Adelbert Ames helped
him in having a new beginning at the Dartmouth College in Hannover, New
Hampshire, and in 1937 the Dartmouth Eye Institute was established for
him. He remained head of the institute until his death in 1940.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In Germany, the Bielschowsky-Gesellschaft für Schielforschung is
named for him.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">His main field of work was the physiology and pathology of space perception
(Raumsinn) and the movements of the eyes. He was a collaborator in the
Handbuch der gesamten Augenheilkunde by Graefe-Saemisch.
