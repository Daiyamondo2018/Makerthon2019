<td><font color="#0000EE">Irish physician, born 27th March, 1797, Dublin; died 20th March, 1853,
Dublin.
</font>
<p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Robert James Graves</b> was one of the leaders of the Irish, or Dublin
school of diagnosis, which emphasised clinical observation of patients.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">He was the son of a clergyman. He received his degree from the University
of Dublin in 1818 after a brilliant undergraduate career. After studying
in London, Berlin, Göttingen, Hamburg and Copenhagen, he returned
to Dublin in 1821 and set up a medical practice, becoming chief physician
at Meath Hospital. He was also physician at the County of Dublin Infirmary
and the Hospital for incurables.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At Meath in Dublin Graves also taught clinical medicine, introducing
reforms of medical training that he had witnessed on his travels. This
included, among other things, bedside teaching, a major novelty in a country
where medical teaching had been ex cathedra only. Graves assigned to advanced
students the responsibility for diagnosis and treatment of ward patients,
under the supervision of the faculty. One of his students was William Stokes
(1804-1878), who soon became his collaborator. Another student of his was
Richard Townsend, who obtained his doctorate at Edinburgh in 1824.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Graves showed the qualities that would ensure a great teacher. He was
tall, somewhat swarthy with a vivacious manner, and like other avant-garde
professors of his time, he gave his lectures in English rather than in
Latin, or Dog Latin as was still the case in most classes in the 1830's.
In his introductory lecture he said: "From the very commencement the student
should set out to witness the progress and effects of sickness and ought
to persevere in the daily observation of disease during the whole period
of his studies".&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Among the innovations introduced in the lectures were the timing of
the pulse by watch and the practicing of giving food and liquids to patients
with fever instead of withholding nourishment. It was on a ward round Graves
light-heartedly suggested to William Stokes that his epitaph should read:
"He fed fevers."&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">As well as the practical importance of bedside learning to ensure that
a graduate was not "a practitioner who has never practised" he emphasised
the importance of research, "learn the duty as well as taste the pleasure
of original work".&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Graves was sometimes sarcastic. In dealing with a colleague's attack
on the use of the stethoscope, which was advocated by himself and Stokes,
he wrote: "We suspect Dr Clutterbuck's sense of hearing must be injured:
for him the 'ear trumpet' magnifies but distorts sound, rendering it less
distinct than before". Dr. Clutterbuck was Henry Clutterbuck, 1770-1856.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In recognition of his achievements in education, Graves was named Regius
professor of the Institute of Medicine in Trinity College. A founder of
the <i>Dublin Journal of Medical and Chemical Science</i>, he served as
one of the journal's editors to his death.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>The trouble with many talents</b>
<br>Graves had an exceptional talent for languages and was once imprisoned
as a Germany spy for 10 days in Austria whilst travelling on foot without
a passport. No one believed an Englishman could speak German so well. On
another journey he saved a ship and its mutinous crew by assuming command
during a storm in the Mediterranean. During a gale the ship sprang leak,
pumps failed and the crew attempted to abandon ship but Graves holed the
one lifeboat with an axe and repaired the pumps with leather from his own
shoes and all aboard survived. Whilst travelling in the Alps he became
acquainted with the famous painter Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851).
They travelled and painted together for several months, eventually parting
company in Rome.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE"><b>Graves&#8217; disease</b>
<br>Graves was the first physician to fully describe exophthalmic goiter,
now called Graves' disease or Basedow's disease. The symptom is protruding
eyes. In 1834 Graves delivered a series of lectures that were published
in 1835. He here describes in detail three patients with palpitations and
enlargement of thyreoidea. One of the patients, in fact described second
hand, had eye symptoms: "The eyeballs were visibly enlarged, to such a
degree the eyelids were unable to shut during sleep and when trying to
close the eye. When the eyes were open the white of the eyes could be seen
in the breadth of several lines around all of cornea."&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Graves gives much space to descriptions of the pulse and the sounds
from the heart. He described how his first patient had such a strong (first)
heart tune that one could hear the heart beat while keeping the ear more
than four feet from the patient's chest. Graves considered the enlargement
of the thyroidea as secondary to the increased heart function. He theorises:&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">"It is obvious, gentlemen, that if palpitations in functional heart
disease can cause swelling of the thyroidea, we can also expect to see
a swelling of this gland as palpitations originate from organic heart disease.&#8221;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Besides hyperthyroidism he also described angioneurotic oedema, scleroderma,
erythromelalgia, the pin-hole pupil in pontine bleeding&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Graves lasting fame rests chiefly on his Clinical Lectures, which were
a model for the day and recommended by none other than Armand Trousseau
(1801-1867), who suggested the term Graves' disease.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">A statue of him was erected in Dublin in 1878.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">«This [the healthy appearance of convalescents from typhus at
Meath Hospital, Dublin] is all the effect of our good feeding; and lest
when I am gone, you may be at a loss for an epitaph for me, let me give
you one, in three words: &#8220;He Fed Fevers.&#8221;
<br>Quoted in A Memorial of Graves, «The Life and Labours of Graves»
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">With William Stokes he edited the Dublin Journal of Medical and Chemical
Science from 1832 to 1842, a journal he had founded with Sir Robert Kane
(1810-1890), physician, chemist, and professor of natural history.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">A collection of various of his papers, including a biography, was published
by William Stokes as Studies in Physiology and Medicine. London, 1863.
