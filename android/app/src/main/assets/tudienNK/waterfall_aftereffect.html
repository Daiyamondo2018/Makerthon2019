		movement in the opposite direction when fixating a stationary object, 
		after having looked at a waterfall for some time. This is an example of 
		phenomena which are used to infer the existence of channels in the 
		visual system. It is suggested that there are two opposed 
		directionally-sensitive neural channels (or neurons) which are normally 
		in balance for stationary stimuli, but when the activity of one channel 
		is fatigued by prolonged stimulation the other one becomes the active 
		one. The waterfall after-effect is a special case of motion or movement 
		after-effect (or motion after-image)</font><blockquote>
